--------- Original GoF Patterns ----------

Decorator Pattern
JMap is a Decorator class
getSignature is a decorate operation
mKey of type JType is the Decoratee class
File Location: /data/s4040112/sourcecodes/zookeeper/zookeeper-jute/src/main/java/org/apache/jute/compiler/JMap.java

Decorator Pattern
JVector is a Decorator class
getSignature is a decorate operation
mElement of type JType is the Decoratee class
File Location: /data/s4040112/sourcecodes/zookeeper/zookeeper-jute/src/main/java/org/apache/jute/compiler/JVector.java


 JType
Strategy Pattern.
JField is the Context class.
JType is the Strategy interface.
Concrete Strategy classes:  JBoolean JByte JCompType JLong JInt JDouble JFloat JMap JString JBuffer JVector
Delegation through mType of type JType

Flyweight Pattern.
Quotas is a flyweight factory.
procZookeeper is a flyweight object (declared public-static-final).
File location: /data/s4040112/sourcecodes/zookeeper/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/Quotas.java

Flyweight Pattern.
CertificatesToPlayWith is a flyweight factory.
RSA_PUBLIC_MODULUS is a flyweight object (declared public-static-final).
File location: /data/s4040112/sourcecodes/zookeeper/zookeeper-server/src/test/java/org/apache/zookeeper/common/CertificatesToPlayWith.java

Mediator Pattern.
Mediator: JMap
Colleagues:  JField JBuffer JVector
FileLocation: /data/s4040112/sourcecodes/zookeeper/zookeeper-jute/src/main/java/org/apache/jute/compiler/JMap.java

Mediator Pattern.
Mediator: JVector
Colleagues:  JMap JBuffer JField
FileLocation: /data/s4040112/sourcecodes/zookeeper/zookeeper-jute/src/main/java/org/apache/jute/compiler/JVector.java

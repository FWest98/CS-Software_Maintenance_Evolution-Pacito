# Internship_RuG_2020

Repository that contains all the information and files related to Filipe Capela's Internship at the University of Groningen for the Master of Computing Science, during the lective year 2019/2020.

The scripts that are used to run the project are located in the scripts folder.

There is a Structure101 project file, which was used to analyze the Archie tool's .jar file.

A working demo is possible to be seen if the command ./github-looper.sh is ran inside the Analyzed_Projects/ant/ folder.
Note: The path of the file needs to be absolute, so the file pinotscript.sh needs to be changed accordingly (the 2nd line of the file).

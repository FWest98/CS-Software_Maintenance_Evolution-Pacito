Description: 

As JDK provides BufferedOutputStream, we could provide BufferingFilteer which does the
same thing, which buffers encoded data and flushes it out when the buffer becomes full or
the flush operation is explicitly requested.  This kind of filter is sometimes useful when
a session is generating very small messages too frequently and consequently generates
unnecessary traffic overhead.

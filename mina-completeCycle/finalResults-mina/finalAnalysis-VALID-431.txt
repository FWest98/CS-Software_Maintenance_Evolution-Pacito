Description: 

The instance variable polledSessions is not thread-safe (i.e. uses ArrayList) and its
access is not always protected (e.g. StatCollector$Worker#run()). Under  heavy load this
is producing an error in the Worker.

The bytesReadThroughput statistic is incorrectly
being set. It is adding up the throughput of written messages.

Instance variables:
msgWrittenThroughput, msgReadThroughput, bytesWrittenThroughputand bytesReadThroughput
could be corrupted and return an unexpected value since they are not thread safe and 2
different threads may be changing them.

Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-456 (Provide mechanism for detecting a dead lock caused by calling IoFuture.await() in an I/O processor thread.)
    * Improved DefaultIoFuture to check dead lock every five seconds.  Checking the dead lock situation is an expensive operation.  However, it shouldn't cost much in most cases because it's checked just every five seconds, which is eternity for computers.

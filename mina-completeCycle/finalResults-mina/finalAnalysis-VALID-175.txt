    DIRMINA-209 - The number of processors for socket connectors and acceptors can be specified via a cxtor parameter. By default, connectors and acceptors each use their own processor.
    Additionally, the delegates have been removed helping to simplify the code.

Description: 

The changes to have SocketIoProcessor have a fixed number of instances that are shared
between connectors and acceptors results in a default performance degradation for
applications that used both. 

This will be fixed by having socket acceptor and connectors
each use their own processor. Additionally, the number of processors for each will be
configurable independently.

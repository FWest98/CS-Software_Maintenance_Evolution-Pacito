commit f946bde597202d88d979d61e6e43ec3a31156f3d
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Removed unused classes implemented poorly
    * Added IoService.isActive() and replaced IoAcceptor.isBound() with it
    * Added IoServiceListenerSupport.isActive(); AbstractIoConnector uses it
    * Moved all calls to IoSession.increaseXXX() to DefaultIoFilterChain
    ** Removed duplicate calls in NioDatagramAcceptor
    ** Moved IoSession.increaseReadMessages() call from ProtocolCodecFilter to DefaultIoFilterChain because it's more accurate when more than one ProtocolCodecFilter is used.
    * Changed all unsafe operations in AbstractIoSession and AbstractIoService 'private'.
    * Resolved DIRMINA-317 (add supporting statistical methods to IoService)
    ** Added getActivationTime() - activationTime is more useful than creationTime
    ** Added getReadBytes()
    ** Added getWrittenBytes()
    ** Added getReadMessages()
    ** Added getWrittenMessages()
    ** Added getScheduledWriteBytes()
    ** Added getScheduledWriteMessages()

commit c3de2a091df0498f83210c76aed7eb284074b3be
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-368 (IoFilter.messageSent should have access to WriteRequest instead of the written message.)
    * Changed the method signature of IoFilter.messageSent() to provide access to WriteRequest
    * WriterRequest became an interface now.  DefaultWriteRequest and WriteRequestWrapper are added.

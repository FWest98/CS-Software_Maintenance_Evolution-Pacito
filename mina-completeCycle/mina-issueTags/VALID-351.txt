Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Fixed issue: DIRMINA-273 Session created with non-existent service
    Fixed issue: DIRMINA-283 Filter.sessionCreated/Filter.sessionOpened called AFTER Filter.filterWrite...
    * Added AbstractIoFilterChain.CONNECT_FUTURE attribute key to store the connect future until the future becomes now.
    * AbstractIoFilterChain.fireSessionOpened() and fireExceptionCaught() take care of finishing the ConnectFuture attached to sessions.
    * Made sure the behavior of ConnectFuture and IoFilterChain is all identical for all transports

commit 654f07f7fe3120dc99b1a240a9f5cf00ba13a076
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-417 (Move idleTime and writeTimeout property to IoSessionConfig (from IoSession).)
    * Moved idleTime and writeTimeout property to IoSessionConfig
    * Added IoSessionConfig.setAll() and added its default implementation to AbstractIoSessionConfig
    * Removed SerialSessionConfig.timeout because it can be replaced with IoService.connectTimeout

commit 0fa430bdacdd97e3f4f563c8389c7105a0e66cbf
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Big Refactoring:
    * Added IoProcessor - a thin layer which is similar to the reactor pattern
    * Renamed AbstractIoFilterChain to DefaultIoFilterChain because of the abstract methods of AbstractIoFilterChain are now moved to IoProcessor interface
    * Moved common parts of various IoFilterChain implementations to DefaultIoFilterChain
    * Removed other unnecessary IoFilterChain implementations
    * Added IoSession.getProcessor() so that DefaultIoFilterChain can access the associated IoProcessor
    * Extracted interface from SerialSession, and all the implementation goes to SerialSessionImpl

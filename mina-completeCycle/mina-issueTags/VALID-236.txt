commit 805db5f3926a9e51d8b9b8539186029e70e7eae9
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Fixed issue: DIRMINA-243 (mark() and autoexpand)
    * Made sure mark is preserved after expansion
    * Refactored ByteBuffer implementation
      * Most base implementation has been extracted into BaseByteBuffer to remove code duplication
    * Added ByteBuffer.capacity()

commit 7b2707ebf121bb92cf84e52f9f4ff38d721fae64
Author: Emmanuel Lecharny <elecharny@apache.org>

    o Changed an error message which was misleading
    o Removed the disposalFuture which is totally useless
    o When calling dispose, kill the executor by calling shutdownNow
    o Don't wait for the dispose() to be done, as we were waiting on our own thread to signal itself on terminaison : a dead eand !
    This is a fix for DIRMINA-755

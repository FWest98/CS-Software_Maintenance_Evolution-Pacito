commit b49aebedf34cf91d021aa23712fd42daf901b68d
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-290 (Make IoService (IoConnector and IoAcceptor) manage only one service.)
    * IoService (IoAcceptor and IoConnector) now can handler only one service at once.
    ** No more default settings.
    * Merged IoServiceConfig implementations into the respective IoService implementations as setters.
    * Removed a few spring framework integration classes which is not necessary now.(Binding and IoAcceptorBeanFactory)

commit 8262d739c80cb2f39a75c24fd8cebf6ea6586a05
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Renamed TransportType to IoServiceMetadata
    * Added IoServiceMetadata.hasFragmentation()
    * Added DefaultIoServiceMetadata
    * Removed static fields in IoServiceMetadata which caused bad coupling
    * Removed IoSession.getTransportType() because IoServiceMetadata can be retrieved via IoSession.getService().getMetadata()
    * Removed transport.socket.nio.support package, and moved the classes there to transport.socket.nio.  Datagram transport doesn't use wrapper anymore.
    * Fixed freezing SocketBindTest

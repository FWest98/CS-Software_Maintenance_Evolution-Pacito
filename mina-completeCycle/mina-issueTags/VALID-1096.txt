commit c5ab3ca1da04960c2e57a25f18c7b3be68be348f
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Replaced NewThreadExecutor with ThreadPoolExecutor with short timeout.
    * AbstractPollingIoConnector's worker now exits even if it's not disposed because the creation overhead of a new thread doesn't exist anymore, and that's because we are using ThreadPoolExecutor.

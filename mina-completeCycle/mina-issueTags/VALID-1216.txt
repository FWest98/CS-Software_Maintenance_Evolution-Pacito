commit 5c080949fc24570573028240172ebd2778f4eeb8
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Renamed ConsumeToDisconnectionDecodingState to ConsumeToEndOfSessionDecodingState
    * Renamed StateMachineProtocolDecoder into DecodingStateProtocolDecoder
    ** DecodingStateProtocolDecoder now works with DecodingState instead of DecodingStateMachine, which is more flexible.

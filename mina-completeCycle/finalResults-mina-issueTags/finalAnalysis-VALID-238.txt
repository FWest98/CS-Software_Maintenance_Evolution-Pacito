Description: 

I've been using the VmPipeConnector for "unit" testing and have come up against a
problem. The the AnonymousSocketAddresses that are handed out are all the very same
instance. Our code relies on each client-side socket being unique and providing a unique
name via toString(). For an InetSocketAddress, the toString() returns ip-address/host and
port. A patch is attached.

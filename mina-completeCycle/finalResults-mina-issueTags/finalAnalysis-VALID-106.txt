Description: 

The current implementation of ByteBuffer pool is designed to increase its size for ever;
it doesn't decrease at all.  This is often a cause of OutOfMemoryError and unexpedly huge
heap size.  There's one viable solution for this issue:
<ul>	<li>Remove the buffers which
have been unused for a long time from the pool.</li></ul>

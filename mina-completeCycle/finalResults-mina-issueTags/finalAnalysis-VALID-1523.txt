Description: 

There has been enourmous demand for supporting proxy such as simple port forwarding and
SOCKS.  We need to investigate what the best way is to provide an extension point for
proxies.

IoFilters are not adequate for proxies because proxies needs changes in the
socket addresses (both local and remote) of IoSession.

Description: 

A user can specify a KeepAlivePolicy for a KeepAliveFilter to tell KeepAliveFilter what
to do when ping timeout occurs.  However, what the user can choose is limited to very
simple operations because KeepAlivePolicy is not extendable but an enum.  We need to
replace it with KeepAliveRequestTimeoutHandler interface which is much more flexible.

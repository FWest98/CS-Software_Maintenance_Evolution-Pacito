Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Fixed issue: DIRMINA-214 (The InputStream that StreamIoHandler provides is closed too early.)
    * StreamIoHandler doesn't close Input/OutputStream.  A user has to close them explicitly.
    * Optimized memory usage of IoSessionOutputStream

While trying to demonstrate the issue I found that the exception
<em>is</em> thrown, but sometimes sessionClosed is invoked before the new thread gets a
chance to read the available data from the stream. I followed the example of the
httpserver that is provided with MINA, only there is no handling of client socket closure
there.

Description: 

There are approximately 100 compiler warnings that deal with java generics.  I would like
to fix these in order to decrease the number of compiler warnings.  I believe that this
would make for cleaner code.

What tool are you using to build MINA 1.0?  You won't see any warnings if you are using
Maven 2.  If your IDE is configured to use the 1.5 source format, please reconfigure it to
use 1.4 format.  We are going to migrate to Java 5 in 1.1.0.  1.0.x will be maintained as
long as 1.1.x (the unstable version) is promoted to 1.2.0 (the stable version).

then the work I<br/>would have to do on this should be placed on hold.  Not a

to develop MINA 1.1 very soon.  Actually 1.0 branch has been moved to branches/mina/1.0
and the trunk contains the initial copy of 1.1.  So you can start fixing those warnings
and provide us a patch against the trunk.PS: You could comment at the JIRA web page
instead of replying to the automatic notification message. 


New Comment: 
Based on Email conversation with Trustin, the trunk contains the initial copy of 1.1. 
Therefore I will start to submit patches based on updates to Java 1.5. 


New Comment: 
This cuts the compiler warnings down to 16 using a default configuration in Eclipse. 


New Comment: 
Should be fixed in 1.1.0

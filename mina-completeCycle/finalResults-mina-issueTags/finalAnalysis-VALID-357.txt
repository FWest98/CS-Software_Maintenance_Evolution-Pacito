commit b49aebedf34cf91d021aa23712fd42daf901b68d
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-290 (Make IoService (IoConnector and IoAcceptor) manage only one service.)
    * IoService (IoAcceptor and IoConnector) now can handler only one service at once.
    ** No more default settings.
    * Merged IoServiceConfig implementations into the respective IoService implementations as setters.
    * Removed a few spring framework integration classes which is not necessary now.(Binding and IoAcceptorBeanFactory)

Description: 

Allowing IoAcceptor to bind more than one ports per one instance makes the API complex. 
Restricting an acceptor to bind to only one port will dramatically simplify the API.  The
properties of IoServiceConfig will be merged into IoService.  Applying this practice to
IoConnector will also be very helpful to implement reconnection feature.

New Comment: 
Removing 'connection' from the title of this issue because both IoAcceptor and IoConnector
should be able to manage more than one connections.  My bad!

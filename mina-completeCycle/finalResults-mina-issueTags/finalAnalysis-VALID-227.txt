commit b7280d51151ea735019edf0f9686bff661656020
Author: Niklas Therning <niklas@apache.org>

    Resolved DIRMINA-229 as suggested by Oleg Kalnichevski. The IoSessionOutputStream.write() methods will now block until the bytes have been written. If the write fails or the session has been closed an IOException will be thrown. The close() method will also block now.

Description: 

IoSessionOutputStream write methods return before the I/O operation is fully completed,
which causes issues in protocol handlers based on blocking InputStream/OutputStream model.
Is it a desired behaviour?

Per discussion with Peter Royal on the HttpComponents mailing
list I am working on a simple HTTP server based on MINA and HttpComponents Core.  HttpCore
does not work with the latest SVN snapshot of MINA without this patch (attached)

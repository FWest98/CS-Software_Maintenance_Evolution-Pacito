Description: 

Currently, when binding an IoAcceptor a single IoHandler is specified that is shared
among all sessions. This shared IoHandler cannot use instance variables (without proper
synchronization), because it is accessed concurrently by multiple threads. The handler
state has to be stored as session attributes. However, if there was one IoHandler per
IoSession, state stored in instance variables of the IoHandler could be used safely.

The
attached zip file contains an implemented solution (as suggested by Niklas Therning) for
this idea. See the following post in the mailing list archive for a detailed
description:

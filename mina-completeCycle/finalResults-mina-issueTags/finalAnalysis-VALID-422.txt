Description: 

the TransportType define the differents TransportType in MINA (Socket,Datagram, VM Pipe).
The types are static and hardcoded. The constructor of Transport type is private. It leave
no room for new Transport.<br/>I propose : <br/>1st  : change the transportType
constructor visibility to public<br/>2snd : move the staticly defined TransportTypes to
the different io.datagram, io.socket, etc.. packages

New Comment: 
Now you can create your own TransportType singletons.  Please check out and refer to
JavaDoc. <img class="emoticon"

separate TransportType constants to each packages, but it looks more clean for
TransportType to have all default constants.  WDYT? 


New Comment: 
Well it's still problematic in trunk for creating a separate package for Serial
communications 


New Comment: 
What about just removing TransportType and using Java String instead?  It has been a
problem whenever we add a new transport type. 


New Comment: 
so far I understand MINA's behaviour, it's looking like a good solution, and going to a
simplify a little

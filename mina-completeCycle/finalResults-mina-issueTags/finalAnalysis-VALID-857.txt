Project: MINA
-----------------

-----------------
Title: [DIRMINA-393] Allow users to choose a Map implementation for storing session attributes.
-----------------

Summary: Allow users to choose a Map implementation for storing session attributes.

Description: 

Currently, users don't have any control over how session attributes are stored and
managed.  Adding SessionAttributesMapFactory property to IoService will give more control
to the users, although we will have to provide the best generic implementation.

It's extremely useful for many applications!<br/>For an example, if you want to implement
a GoogleFileSystem like system, you need to synchronize huge data packets within several
chunk servers.<br/>Suppose, if every request attribute size is larger than 2 mega bytes
and you have to handle 1k clients(of course, this is not the chunk server scenario), the
sessions attributes will consume 2000 mega memory!<br/>If the Map can be implemented by
users, users may adopt other memory/disk swap technology to handle these cases. I have
experience to do this kind of jobs.  I use the BerkerlyDB java edition to do this.  It
will be excited to add this feature into Mina. If it does happen, Mina is really for
multi-purpose.<br/>If there is no one else to pick up this job, I guess I can participate
to do this and implement the JE map edition for Mina. 


New Comment: 
Is there really a need to store that much data in your session attributes? 


New Comment: 
Sometimes, it's needed. Especially when you developed an application server framework that
is used by other developers.<br/>You usually told them send an request and add handler to
deal with the response. Most of them don't have much knowledge for the request size. Some
of them may send huge requests because they think your application server can handle them.
If the server cannot take this kind of burden to throw OutOfMemoryException, your whole
app server framework will be complained. I agree in fact, in the user level, they can
control the request size to simply split big requests to small requests. But some
developers may not be happy if you ask them to do it manually.

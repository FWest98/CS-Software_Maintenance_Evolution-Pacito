commit f946bde597202d88d979d61e6e43ec3a31156f3d
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Removed unused classes implemented poorly
    * Added IoService.isActive() and replaced IoAcceptor.isBound() with it
    * Added IoServiceListenerSupport.isActive(); AbstractIoConnector uses it
    * Moved all calls to IoSession.increaseXXX() to DefaultIoFilterChain
    ** Removed duplicate calls in NioDatagramAcceptor
    ** Moved IoSession.increaseReadMessages() call from ProtocolCodecFilter to DefaultIoFilterChain because it's more accurate when more than one ProtocolCodecFilter is used.
    * Changed all unsafe operations in AbstractIoSession and AbstractIoService 'private'.
    * Resolved DIRMINA-317 (add supporting statistical methods to IoService)
    ** Added getActivationTime() - activationTime is more useful than creationTime
    ** Added getReadBytes()
    ** Added getWrittenBytes()
    ** Added getReadMessages()
    ** Added getWrittenMessages()
    ** Added getScheduledWriteBytes()
    ** Added getScheduledWriteMessages()

Description: 

I was looking at the IoService class and noticed that there are some fields that would be
nice to have:

    long getCreationTime();<br/>    long getReadBytes();<br/>    long
getWrittenBytes();<br/>    long getReadMessages();<br/>    long
getWrittenMessages();

These methods are in the IoSession interface, and thought it would
make sense to also have them in the IoService interface.  The last 4 might be a little
tougher to implement, but it would be nice for times in which we need some performance
numbers.

commit f946bde597202d88d979d61e6e43ec3a31156f3d
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Removed unused classes implemented poorly
    * Added IoService.isActive() and replaced IoAcceptor.isBound() with it
    * Added IoServiceListenerSupport.isActive(); AbstractIoConnector uses it
    * Moved all calls to IoSession.increaseXXX() to DefaultIoFilterChain
    ** Removed duplicate calls in NioDatagramAcceptor
    ** Moved IoSession.increaseReadMessages() call from ProtocolCodecFilter to DefaultIoFilterChain because it's more accurate when more than one ProtocolCodecFilter is used.
    * Changed all unsafe operations in AbstractIoSession and AbstractIoService 'private'.
    * Resolved DIRMINA-317 (add supporting statistical methods to IoService)
    ** Added getActivationTime() - activationTime is more useful than creationTime
    ** Added getReadBytes()
    ** Added getWrittenBytes()
    ** Added getReadMessages()
    ** Added getWrittenMessages()
    ** Added getScheduledWriteBytes()
    ** Added getScheduledWriteMessages()

Title: [DIRMINA-317] add supporting statistical methods to IoService

Description: 

I was looking at the IoService class and noticed that there are some fields that would be
nice to have:

    long getCreationTime();<br/>    long getReadBytes();<br/>    long
getWrittenBytes();<br/>    long getReadMessages();<br/>    long
getWrittenMessages();

These methods are in the IoSession interface, and thought it would
make sense to also have them in the IoService interface.  The last 4 might be a little
tougher to implement, but it would be nice for times in which we need some performance
numbers.

New Comment: 
This patch adds creation time support to IoService. 


New Comment: 
Once these methods are implemented, we could optimize StatCollector and result in more
correct statistics. 


New Comment: 
to make this patch easier, I think it makes the most sense to place the code in the
BaseIoService class.  Thoughts? 


New Comment: 
We need to add getScheduledWriteMessages() and getScheduledWriteBytes(), too.  (See <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRMINA-276" title="[MINA] How to get the
number of being-processed messages?" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="DIRMINA-276"><del>DIRMINA-276</del></a>) 


New Comment: 
All proposed methods have been added except for getCreationTime().  creationTime has been
replaced with activationTime, which is set when the service is actually activated (e.g. on
bind). 


New Comment: 
Now we are ready to refactor our stat collectors...

Mark, please confirm and close.

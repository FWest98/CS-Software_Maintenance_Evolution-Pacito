Description: 

Example code of a simple chat server which is configured via Spring. There are several
directories, starting from the simplest server code  with no Spring configuration, to the
most advanced one, which offers some functionality by using JMX features too.

Sources of the different chat servers and readme.txt with explanations on how to run it. 


New Comment: 
Thank you Pablo first of all!  We didn't have enough time to merge your code into our
trunk, but we will do merge it soon! 


New Comment: 
If we can merge this in I think that would resolve <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRMINA-150" title="Create examples of using
the Spring integration package" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="DIRMINA-150"><del>DIRMINA-150</del></a> as well. I've had a quick look at
the example and it depends on Java5. Is that a problem? I think we could remove the Java5
stuff quite easily but then we will not get the Spring JMX features, at least not without
some more modifications. WDYT? 


New Comment: 
I used Spring annotations for exposing a couple of methods  via JMX. Spring offers also a
1.4 compatible way of creating those using jakarta Commons Attributes :<a
href="http://www.springframework.org/docs/reference/jmx.html" class="external-link"
rel="nofollow">http://www.springframework.org/docs/reference/jmx.html</a>20.3.2. Using
source-Level metadataI could do that change in the source and mention it in the
documentation to be compatible with 1.4. 


New Comment: 
Hmmm, I don't know if commons attributes is such a good idea since they need an extra
compilation step. How about using MethodNameBasedMBeanInfoAssembler instead? That way the
JMX stuff would be specified only in the Spring config file, right? Please correct me if
I'm wrong. I haven't used Spring's JMX support myself so I might be totally wrong. 


New Comment: 
I've made an initial check in. The code is in src/main/java/org/apache/mina/example/chat.
I've only done some minor modifications, mainly to support Java 1.4. What remains is the
Spring JMX stuff. I think the best would be to use MethodNameBasedMBeanInfoAssembler if
possible. I'll see if I can get that to work and then I will check in the rest.Pablo,
thank you very much for this contribution! 


New Comment: 
Unfortunately I did not have the time to try MethodNameBasedMBeanInfoAssembler but I do
think it will work. I keep following the project, I will syncrhonize the sources and
certainly, I will try to contribute the part with JMX support compatible with 1.4. 


New Comment: 
I've checked in some more code which enables SSL support (in client and server) and basic
JMX support using Spring. Pablo, let me know what you think and close this issue if you
think the example looks ok. Thanks!

Description: 

Filters which queues received events into a collection needs to convert a method
invocation into an event object. ExecutorFilter and SSLFilter are good examples, and we
might have more than that in the near future.  It would be great to extract Event and
EventType types from ExecutorFilter and to provide them as a utility.

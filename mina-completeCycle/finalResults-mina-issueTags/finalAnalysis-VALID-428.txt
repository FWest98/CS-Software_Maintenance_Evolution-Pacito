Description: 

Sometimes when using VmPipe transport, event sequences get out of order. Namely, the
messageReceived method is invoked before the sessionOpened. To following sequence of
events highlights the problem:
<ul class="alternate" type="square">	<li>using
VmPipeConnector and VmPipeAcceptor</li>	<li>client connects to server</li>	<li>server's
IoHandler#sessionOpened method is called</li>	<li>server sends a message from the
sessionOpened method</li>	<li>client receives that message
(IoHandler#messageReceived)</li>	<li>client's IoHandler#sessionOpened method is
invoked</li></ul>
IoHandler#sessionOpened should always be invoked before the first
invocation of IoHandler#messageReceived.

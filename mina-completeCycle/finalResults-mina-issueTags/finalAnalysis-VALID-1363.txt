Author: Niklas Therning <niklas@apache.org>

    Fixed DIRMINA-559: StateMachineProxyFactory has been renamed to StateMachineProxyBuilder and there are now some boolean flags which control whether methods on the proxied interfaces which cannot be converted into events should be ignored or not.

Description: 

Currently, it is not possible to create a state machine proxy for IoFilter since this
interface has methods which doesn't take an IoSession as argument (e.g. onPreAdd())

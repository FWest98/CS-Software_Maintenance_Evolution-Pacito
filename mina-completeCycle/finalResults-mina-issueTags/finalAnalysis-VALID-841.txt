Description: 

In several places (Executors and Connectors) it is called the method Thread.setName.
<br/>In an applet context this is forbidden by the sandbox, and a SecurityException
arises.

Provided is a patch that creates the class org.apache.mina.util.ThreadUtil which
encapsulates the method call Thread.setName in a try/catch block and logs a warning if a
SecurityException is thrown, and modifies all current calls to Thread.setName to use the
ThreadUtil class

New Comment: 
the patch! 


New Comment: 
Fixed.  Instead of introducing ThreadUtil, I modified NamePreservingRunnable which is
widely used by I/O workers.  All setName() calls are now handled by
NamePreservingRunnable, and therefore NamePreservingRunnable takes care of the raised
exceptions now.  Please confirm this bug is fixed and close this issue.

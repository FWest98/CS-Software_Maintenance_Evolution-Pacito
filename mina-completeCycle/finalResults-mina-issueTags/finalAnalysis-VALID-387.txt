commit adf11feaec713566949d08a0adbaaaa4c2ed4a34
Author: Niklas Therning <niklas@apache.org>

    * DIRMINA-314: LoggingFilter will now log each event to different loggers. The loggers share a common prefix which is configurable. By default this prefix will be the name of the logger used by SessionLog.
    * Made SessionLog.getLogger() public and added SessionLog.getPrefix().
    * The logger and prefix used by SessionLog can now be configured using the static SessionLog.setPrefix() and SessionLog.setLogger() methods. This is easier than having to add an attribute to the session.

Description: 

It would be nice to be able to set my own logger name for LoggingFilter to use. It can be
done today by setting an attribute in my session but then the prefix used by SessionLog
will be null. 

It would also be nice to be able to set the log level to be used.
Currently the level is always INFO.

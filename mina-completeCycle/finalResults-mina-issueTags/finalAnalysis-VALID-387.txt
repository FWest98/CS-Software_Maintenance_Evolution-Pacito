commit adf11feaec713566949d08a0adbaaaa4c2ed4a34
Author: Niklas Therning <niklas@apache.org>

    * DIRMINA-314: LoggingFilter will now log each event to different loggers. The loggers share a common prefix which is configurable. By default this prefix will be the name of the logger used by SessionLog.
    * Made SessionLog.getLogger() public and added SessionLog.getPrefix().
    * The logger and prefix used by SessionLog can now be configured using the static SessionLog.setPrefix() and SessionLog.setLogger() methods. This is easier than having to add an attribute to the session.

Description: 

It would be nice to be able to set my own logger name for LoggingFilter to use. It can be
done today by setting an attribute in my session but then the prefix used by SessionLog
will be null. 

It would also be nice to be able to set the log level to be used.
Currently the level is always INFO.

New Comment: 
I would like to add that I think the default logger name should be changed.Currently the
SessionLog class logs all messages using the Logger classname of my IoHandler.  This
presents a problem for me in that I can no longer differentiate log messages emitted from
the SessionLog class versus log messages emitted from my own IoHandler class.  (Although
setting my own logger name for LoggingFilter will mitigate this problem it would be nice
if the default changed to something that isn't going to collide with the user's logging
names out of the box.) 


New Comment: 
SessionLog.setLogger(session, logger) and SessionLog.setPrefix(session, prefix) have been
added. The default logger used by SessionLog has been changed. It'll now append
.SessionLog to the name of the IoHandler class and use that as the name of the default
logger.The log level used by LoggingFilter can now be changed using
LoggingFilter.setDefaultLogLevel() and LoggingFilter.setExceptionCaughtLogLevel(). The
defaultLogLevel will be used for all events except exceptionCaught which will use the
exceptionCaughtLogLevel. The default is INFO for both of them.LoggingFilter will use
different loggers for each event. This makes it simpler to filter out unwanted events. The
default prefix for the loggers is the name of the logger used by SessionLog (e.g.
org.apache.mina.example.echoserver.EchoProtocolHandler.SessionLog.sessionOpened).

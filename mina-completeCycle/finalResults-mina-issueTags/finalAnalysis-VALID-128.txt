Description: 

Since ServiceRegistry has been removed from the core API, users had to add
ThreadPoolFilters manually.  It would be great if there's a way to configure
ThreadPoolFilters more easily.  My suggestion is add a ThreadModel interface.  Here's an
example:

acceptor.getConfig().setThreadModel( ThreadModel.MANUAL ); // Single thread
mode<br/>acceptor.getConfig().setThreadModel( new PooledThreadModel( "LDAP", 16 ) ); //
One thread pool with max. 16 threads.

The default property will be: new
PooledThreadModel( "AnonymousIoService", 16 ).  This means you have to change your code to
retain the previous thread pool composition:
<ul>	<li>call setThreadModel(
ThreadModel.MANUAL ),</li>	<li>or remove your code that adds a thread pool
filter.</li></ul>

Description: 

After reading the article <span class="error">&#91;Embedding FtpServer in 5
minutes&#93;</span>, I've tried it myself. The following is my source code. The server
could not be started while I was using mina-core-2.0.0-M5.jar. If the jar was changed to
mina-core-2.0.0-M4.jar everything would went well.

package org.cxz.mina;<br/>import
org.apache.ftpserver.FtpServer;<br/>import
org.apache.ftpserver.FtpServerFactory;<br/>import
org.apache.ftpserver.ftplet.FtpException;<br/>public class FtpSvrMgr {<br/>	public static
void main(String[] args) throws FtpException 
{		FtpServerFactory serverFactory = new
FtpServerFactory();		FtpServer server = serverFactory.createServer();		// start the
server		server.start();	}
}

Exceptions:

Exception in thread "main"
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
org.apache.mina.transport.socket.SocketAcceptor.bind(Ljava/net/SocketAddress;)V<br/>	at
org.apache.ftpserver.listener.nio.NioListener.start(NioListener.java:182)<br/>	at
org.apache.ftpserver.impl.DefaultFtpServer.start(DefaultFtpServer.java:77)<br/>	at
org.cxz.mina.FtpSvrMgr.main(FtpSvrMgr.java:14)

This seems odd. I've tried replacing M4 for M5 and get no problems. And the
IoAcceptor.bind() method that it claims to be missing is one of the very core methods in
MINA which has not changed for a very long time.Could you maybe try attaching your copy of
MINA M5? 


New Comment: 
When the m4 is used, there's no issue. 


New Comment: 
The issues happens when we use the m5. 


New Comment: 
The attach is the m5 jar, which has been tried. 


New Comment: 
Chang is right. And this is my fault ... :/I have changed the API from :    void
bind(SocketAddress address) throws IOException;to    void bind(SocketAddress... addresses)
throws IOException;thinking that it cover the case of a single argument.I will restore the
previous API.Sorry for that.

I've reproduced the previous scenerio, and the m5 version mina-core works well.<br/>This
is my first time to take part in open source project.<br/>Thanks you guys.

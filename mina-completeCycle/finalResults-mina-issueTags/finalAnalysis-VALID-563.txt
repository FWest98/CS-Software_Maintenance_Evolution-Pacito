Description: 

Some applications don't need to receive events in order, but need to process events more
simultaneously for performance.  ExecutorFilter could provide an option that disables
event ordering for such applications.

Hi Trustin,I have made some changes in ExecutorFilter.java class to handle parallel
processing, but I think we need to put that code in some other class, say, a sub-class of
"ExecutorFilter" and let the user specify a flag (in SocketAcceptorConfig ), to indicate
if parallel processing is required. Depending on that initialize the appropriate executor
filter class. This is just a design suggestion, may be you can think of a better
alternative. Thanks,

New Comment: 
mina-sm has been moved into trunk and has been renamed to statemachine. The code has been
moved to the o.a.m.statemachine package. I've updated the root pom and made a proper
sub-module pom in statemachine. I think I've got the poms right. Let me know if I've made
some stupid mistake.

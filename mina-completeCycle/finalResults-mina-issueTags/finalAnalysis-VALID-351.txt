Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Fixed issue: DIRMINA-273 Session created with non-existent service
    Fixed issue: DIRMINA-283 Filter.sessionCreated/Filter.sessionOpened called AFTER Filter.filterWrite...
    * Added AbstractIoFilterChain.CONNECT_FUTURE attribute key to store the connect future until the future becomes now.
    * AbstractIoFilterChain.fireSessionOpened() and fireExceptionCaught() take care of finishing the ConnectFuture attached to sessions.
    * Made sure the behavior of ConnectFuture and IoFilterChain is all identical for all transports

Description: 

The local address, which is specified when an IoHandler is bound, and the local address,
that IoSession.getLocalAddress(), are different from each other.  Sessions are not being
recycled at all because we are using the former to put the session to the recycler and
using the latter to get the session from the recycler.  These two address can differ when
the running system is under mixed IP system (IPv4 and IPv6).

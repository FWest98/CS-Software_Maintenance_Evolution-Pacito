Description: 

IoSession.suspendRead() changes the sessions's traffic mask and notifies the
SocketIoProcessor.  It is a normal behavior that the actual traffic control occurs
asynchronously.  For example, If a user calls IoSession.suspendRead() after receiving a
message after ExecutorFilter doesn't assure he or she receives another message even after
suspendRead() is called.

However, it must guaranteed that no more messageReceived event
is fired immediately after suspendRead() is called from the same thread that
SocketIoProcessor runs for users who need precise traffic control.

To resolve this issue,
ProtocolCodecFilter should stop calling decoder as soon as the traffic mask is updated.

New Comment: 
ProtocolCodecFilter's internal ProtocolDecoderOutput implementation now stops flushing
events when read operation is suspended.

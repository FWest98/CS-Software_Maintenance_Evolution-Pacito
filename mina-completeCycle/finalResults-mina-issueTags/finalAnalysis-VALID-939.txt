Description: 

As discussed here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2omrl9" class="external-link"

For now, we use String to identify event
types, which is somewhat unsafe.  Using an enum might be useful, but there are a few
disadvantages:
<ul>	<li>Wildcard event type cannot be used, which could be extended
further (e.g. "message*" or "session(Opened|Closed)")</li></ul>
Probably sticking to
String might be the best solution? <img class="emoticon"

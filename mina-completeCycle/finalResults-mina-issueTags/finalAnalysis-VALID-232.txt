Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

Description: 

A few new threads are created for new SocketConnectors when they attempt to connect to a
remote host. Two of these (AnonymousIoService-x-y) are not cleaned up which can eventually
lead to OutOfMemoryError or other strange behaviour. 

It can be avoided by reusing
SocketConnectors, but I don't think this should be necessary.

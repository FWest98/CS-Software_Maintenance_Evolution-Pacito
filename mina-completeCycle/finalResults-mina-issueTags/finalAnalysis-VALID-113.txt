commit b6a4ebf0451647ef394ebe5cfb8e99786886b5f5
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Related issue: DIRMINA-179 (Stream compression support)
    * Applied Vinod's patch
    ** Removed algorithm parameter because ZLib is the only algorithm for now.  We'll have to provide an interface such as CompressionAlgorithm and let user provide it as a parameter.
    * systemPath in pom.xml doesn't work well with the bundled Eclipse plugin; upgraded to 2.1

Description: 

A MINA filter that supports Stream compression using the zlib algorithm.  Since it needs
to stream data, it should support partial flushes, using the Z_SYNC_FLUSH /
Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH method.

The compression filter implementation.  This is against the mina 0.9.2 release.

and close this issue.  We could create another issue to add more compression algorithms. 


New Comment: 
Vinod's update:Vinod: in Zlib.java<br/>Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH has to be replaced with
Z_SYNC_FLUSH<br/>my mistake<br/>Trustin: Oh I see.<br/>Vinod: it doesnt make a difference
actually<br/>but its potentially confusing

New Comment: 
Only TestBackupNode failed for "ant test" but it is not related.  See <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-192" title="TestBackupNode sometimes
fails" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="HDFS-192"><del>HDFS-192</del></a>. 


New Comment: 
+1Nits:<ol>	<li>BlockReceiver.java - Indenting of <tt>op</tt> declaration around line 854,
is not indented with the rest of the code (though the existing code does not follow 2
space indentation)</li>	<li>Use <tt>read(in)</tt> method instead
<tt>valueOf(in.readByte()</tt>. Currently both these methods are used. Perhaps
<tt>valueOf()</tt> could be private. This will also be better in case these fields change
from byte to some other type.</li></ol>

New Comment: 
+1 for the new patch 


New Comment: 
Got no failure in unit tests this time.  (TestBackupNode is really unrelated to this.  The
patch does not fix it.) 


New Comment: 
I have committed this.

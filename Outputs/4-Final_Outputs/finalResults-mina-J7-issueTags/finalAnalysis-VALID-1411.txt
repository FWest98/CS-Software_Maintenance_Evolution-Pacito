commit e0316ce98cd7313ca36140e0095d42496a3c469d
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Fixed issue: DIRMINA-578 in tennis example version 1.1.7 is fine but for version 2.0M1, there's a funny output order (all RCVD first and SENT last).
    * The root cause of the problem is that VmPipeFilterChain purely relies on method invocation chaining for every messageReceived/Sent event emission.  I made messageSent event is queued first and flushed later so the event order is reversed.

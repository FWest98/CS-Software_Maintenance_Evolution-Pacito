Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-269 (Cancellation operation for ConnectFuture)
    * Added ConnectFuture.cancel()
    * Added cancellation feature to NioSocketConnector
    * Other connector implementations don't need for cancellation operation effectively, so no change has been made.
    * Added AbstractIoConnector.finishSessionInitialization() to remove code duplication

Description: 

Currently I'm using the following logic to connect to server

ConnectFuture future =
socket.connect(SocketAddress, IoHandler);<br/>future.join();<br/>try {<br/>    session =
future.getSession();<br/>} catch (Exception e) {<br/>    // e.getCause() tells the
error<br/>}

it waits till the connection is established. but I want the user to be able
to stop the connect process while it is not yet established. for example in cases that
Connection_Timeout would occur, the user should wait till the time out is finished. is it
possible to stop it whenever we desire?

New Comment: 
This kind of functionality maybe also needed in a proxy server where the connection to the
proxied server should be closed if the proxy client is closing the connection. 


New Comment: 
There's already connection timeout setting.SocketConnectorConfig cfg = new
SocketConnectorConfig();<br/>cfg.setConnectTimeout( 10 ); // 10 secondsconnector.bind(
address, handler, cfg );Please reopen this issue if this setting doesn't work. 


New Comment: 
Setting timeout is not the what I need<br/>I want to be able to cancel the connection
before timeout is over<br/>For example by calling future.cancel()<br/>The client user may
have entered some wrong host names and soon he wants to cancel the current connection to
enter another one, instead of waiting N seconds till the connection is timed out 


New Comment: 
Now I see your point.  I edited the subject of the issue for the clearer description. 
Because it's a new feature, we are going to add it in 2.x.

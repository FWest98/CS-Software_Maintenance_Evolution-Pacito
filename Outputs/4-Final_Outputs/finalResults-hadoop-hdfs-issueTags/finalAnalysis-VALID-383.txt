Description: 

abstract method createIdentifier() is being added in Common (<a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6419" title="Change RPC layer to
support SASL based mutual authentication" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="HADOOP-6419"><del>HADOOP-6419</del></a>) and needs to be implemented by
DelegationTokenSecretManager. This allows the RPC Server's authentication layer to
deserialize received TokenIdentifiers.

This is a small change required by <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6419" title="Change RPC layer to
support SASL based mutual authentication" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="HADOOP-6419"><del>HADOOP-6419</del></a>. 


New Comment: 
Add a new patch that enables the NameNode to use DelegationToken to authenticate users
over RPC (based on RPC changes done in <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6419" title="Change RPC layer to
support SASL based mutual authentication" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="HADOOP-6419"><del>HADOOP-6419</del></a>).ran full test suit locally and
found 2 test (TestBalancer and TestDFSRollback) failed. Re-ran those 2 tests individually
multiple times and they all passed. Wasn't able to run test-patch. 


New Comment: 
attaching a new patch that matches the latest Common changes. 


New Comment:

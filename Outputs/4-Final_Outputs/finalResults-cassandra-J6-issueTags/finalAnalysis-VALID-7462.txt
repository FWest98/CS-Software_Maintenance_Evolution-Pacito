Description: 

The cqlsh tool has history support. If you press the up arrow, you get previous
entries.

If you do a multi-line command however like:
<div class="preformatted panel"
style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent"><pre> cqlsh &gt;
dosomething;</pre></div></div>
when you press the up arrow you get each individual
statement separately. (First "something;" and then "do").

This is not useful if you type
a large create statement and typo one of the pieces.

It'd be nice if cqlsh supported
multi-line history items and could bring them back with the up arrow.

Patch to provide multi-line history support 


New Comment: 
A bit of interesting behaviour worth noting:If you have a multi-line string as your last
history line, and you hit the up arrow and then enter, it will not add it to the history
again. This is intentional. However, if you type out the multi-line command that's already
in your history, Python's readline module will re-record the lines that you typed so your
multi-line command gets pushed back in the history. 


New Comment: 
Also I just realized that if you exit out of cqlsh and go back in, the written history has
everything broken out by line so you once again lose the multi-line support for anything
saved prior running cqlsh.This is still a step in the right direction I think. To solve we
could just concat the string together before calling readline.add_history(). 


New Comment: 
Patch that makes multi-line history work WITH written history files.This can be used in
place of the other patch.

Description: 

select * from visitor_audit where visitor_id in ('1_172892701', '1_316755431') order by
audit_id desc limit 6;

gives error

Bad Request: Ordering is only supported is the first
part of the PRIMARY KEY is restricted by an Equal or a IN

which seems to be what the
query is doing. 

But it only supports Equal, fix error message.

New Comment: 
Yeah, IN was disallowed "recently" but I forgot to update the error message.<br/>+1 (I
believe this affect 1.1 too though).

New Comment: 
Patch also unifies skipBytes checking into skipBytesFully even where we really are only
skipping an int's worth of bytes. 


New Comment: 
Small nitpick: it could be nice to add a message to the eof exception saying how many
bytes out of how many have been skipped before reaching eof, but that'd require to do a
catch and re-throw in the 'long' version.+1 


New Comment: 
v2 adds length information to EOFException

Description: 

This is nothing against cloudera or cdh.

For a time we had depended on a version of cdh3
which included a fix required to make hadoop output streaming work with Cassandra. 
However, in 0.8.x, output streaming support has been removed.  We should therefore remove
dependency on the cloudera maven repo and cdh and replace them with hadoop-0.20.203 or
whatever the current stable release is for hadoop for the build.

This likely just
involves removing the cloudera maven repo and replacing the cdh maven build dependencies
with apache stable release dependencies.  This would be in the main build.xml.  Worth
checking would be the dependencies in the examples and/or contrib modules.

(0.8) Removes CDH repo, uses hadoop 0.20.203.0 from maven central.

Same for 1.0 


New Comment: 
Looks good, though I'm not sure if we even need to depend on hadoop-streaming any longer. 


New Comment:

I will wait until <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2341"
title="Cli support for counters" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-2341"><del>CASSANDRA-2341</del></a> is committed, it brings
notation of the positive/negative integers into CLI grammar. 


New Comment: 
We should fix negative ints in 0.7 unless it's a huge pain.  (Counters will stay 0.8
only.) 


New Comment: 
Gotcha! No, this won't be a pain at all.

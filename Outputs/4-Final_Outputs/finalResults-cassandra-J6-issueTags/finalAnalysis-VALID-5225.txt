Description: 

Implementing "cassandra-cli --version" command line option would make it easier to write
bug reports and check the versions of tools in use. Or if you want to make it a CLI
command inside the tool, I don't know. --version option seems to be the standard way.

New Comment: 
Can we just make the cli print FBUtilities.getReleaseVersionString() on startup? 


New Comment: 
committed, w/ addition of "CLI" string to make clear that this is the cli's version, not
necessarily the version of the server we're talking to

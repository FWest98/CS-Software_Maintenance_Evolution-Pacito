Description: 

Included a patch to the current test script to demonstrate that CassandraStorage does not
support counter columns, as well as a patch to fix the issue.

The core reason is that
CassandraStorage assumes that counters can be unpacked using CounterColumnType, when in
fact the column value is already a Long.

New Comment: 
Patch for tests; another patch for CassandraStorage. 


New Comment: 
v2 to nip counters directly in parseType so we can catch them in super columns too. 


New Comment: 
V2 patch wasn't working, getDefaultMarshallers() was invoking TypeParser.parse() directly.
 Here's v3 which fixes that issue (and protects against null reference).

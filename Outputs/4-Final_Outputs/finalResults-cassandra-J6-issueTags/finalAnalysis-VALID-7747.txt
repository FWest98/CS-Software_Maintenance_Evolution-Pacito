Description: 

Cassandra isn't starting the log4j auto-reload thread because it requires
-Dlog4j.defaultInitOverride=true on initialization. Is there a reason to not do this when
installed from the Debian package?

I don't see why not.  I guess when we added the reloading to bin/cassandra we neglected to
also add it to the init.

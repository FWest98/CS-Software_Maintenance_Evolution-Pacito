Description: 

running a command like 
<div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div
class="preformattedContent panelContent"><pre>"update column family shorturls with
read_repair_chance=0.4;"</pre></div></div>
results in the value being set to 0.0040. Was
expecting it to be 0.4.

Affects 0.7.6.-2; seems to be fixed on trunk/0.8.

New Comment: 
Straightforward patch.<br/>If the help says it expects a double from 0.0 to 1.0, it
shouldn't then divide by 100 as if expecting a percentage.

Attached patch on trunk.This actually changes the export format to add a column type.
Previously we were using the cardinality of the json column to decided whether this was a
standard or expired column. We could still have done it here (since counter has 1 extra
field while expiring columns have 2), but this feels fragile and not very
extensible.Anyway the new and old formats are incompatible, but SSTableImport is able to
read the old format.

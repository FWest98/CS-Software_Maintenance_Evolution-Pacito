New Comment: 
Doesn't this mean batch sizes can be arbitrarily large?  Not only will this cause latency
spikes on the server but you could OOM building the monster batch. 


New Comment:

New Comment: 
reverted 


New Comment: 
another go at the patch 


New Comment: 
lgtm, committed (we'll try to get it in to 0.7.3 re-spin)

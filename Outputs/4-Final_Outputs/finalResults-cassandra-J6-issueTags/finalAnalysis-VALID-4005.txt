Description: 

There is not check when 
{LOCAL|EACH}
_QUORUM is used than we do use NTS, hence using
such CL with simpleStrategy for instance result in
<div class="preformatted panel"
style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent"><pre>ERROR
[pool-1-thread-1] 2011-05-09 10:44:29,728 Cassandra.java (line 2960) Internal error
processing insertjava.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy
cannot be cast to
org.apache.cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy...</pre></div></div>

Description: 

Primary use-case for `show schema` is to persist current schema to load it later
(possibly on the other machines), so if we output it into timestamped file this would make
a good bonus in usability.

New Comment: 
saves the file with CLI schema definitions and then just displays it's contents to the
user + prints the name of the file for later use.Format of the file name "schema<span
class="error">&#91;-&lt;keyspace&gt;&#93;</span>-&lt;timestamp&gt;.cli"<span
class="error">&#91;-keyspace&#93;</span> part is only added when `show schema` was
executed while one of the keyspaces was selected using `use &lt;keyspace&gt;` command. 


New Comment: 
Using a timestamp is fine for the case of 'show schema', but let's change the extension to
'.txt' and also give the user the ability to specify the file, like 'show schema foo.txt'
that way if this is being automated the filename is predictable. 


New Comment: 
original command is `show schema &lt;keyspace&gt;' so I decided to better hook it out with
sessionState.out

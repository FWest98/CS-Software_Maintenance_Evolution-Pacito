Description: 

sstablescrub has Xmx hardcoded to 256MB.  This is not enough in my installation and
causes an OOM.

Since it's meant to be run offline, the memory usually allocated to the
daemon can be safely given to the tool.

Attached is a patch that makes it respect
$MAX_HEAP_SIZE (with fallback to 256MB if not defined)

Description: 

Change incremental backup setting via nodetool. In some scenarios, we'd like to control
whether the incremental backup is switched on or off without redeploying

Comments: 

New Comment: 
patch seems fine, the only point of note is that using nodetool enablebackup doesn't set
the setting permanently, as the setting is not saved to the system tables. 


New Comment: 
SGTM; that's true for any of the nodetool configure-at-runtime commands.

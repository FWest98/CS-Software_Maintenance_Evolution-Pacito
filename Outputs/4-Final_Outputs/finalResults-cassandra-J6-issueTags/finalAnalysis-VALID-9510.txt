Description: 

It's desirable to be able to monitor how many read repair operations (background or
blocking) are performed, and how many of those detect mismatches. This allows configuring
a low level of background read repair, and detect if inconsistencies start to get out of
bounds and alert on those conditions. A follow-up patch will be provided.

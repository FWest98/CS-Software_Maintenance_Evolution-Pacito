Description: 

Even with LCS you're going to frequently have 6 or 7 levels, with data in only one or two
of those.  With randomly distributed writes you'll have overlapping sstables in the other
levels so having a bloom filter will be good to avoid hitting disk.

New Comment: 
Patch makes LCS default to 0.1 FP, which is half the size (5 buckets vs 10 per row) of the
default 0.01 for STCS.

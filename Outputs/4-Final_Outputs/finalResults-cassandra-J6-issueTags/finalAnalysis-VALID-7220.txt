Description: 

Some of the help provided for the CLI is not written correctly.

For
example:

<tt>describe                Describe a keyspace and it's column families or
column family in current keyspace.</tt><br/><tt>drop column family      Remove a column
family and it's data.</tt><br/><tt>drop keyspace           Remove a keyspace and it's
data.</tt>

Here all the <b>it's</b> should be <b>its</b>.

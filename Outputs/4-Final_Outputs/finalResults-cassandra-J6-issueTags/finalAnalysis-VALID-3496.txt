New Comment: 
If the environment variable is set, it wins. If not, and it's already stored in the job
configuration, do nothing. If it doesn't exist at all, fail. 


New Comment: 
+1 - works where before it would error out in mapreduce mode (post storefunc). I did
suggest maybe unifying the conditions and using an else or something to make it more
concise, but that's a trivial thing. 


New Comment: 
Committed, thanks!

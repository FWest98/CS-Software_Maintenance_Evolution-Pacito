Description: 

In 0.7 we log at debug when returning TOE back to the client:
<div class="code panel"
style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent"><pre class="code-java">. 
     <span class="code-keyword">catch</span> (TimeoutException e)         {           
logger.debug(<span class="code-quote">"... timed out"</span>);            <span
class="code-keyword">throw</span> <span class="code-keyword">new</span>
TimedOutException();        }</pre></div></div>
This is primarily useful when reading
through debug logs to make it obvious when StorageProxy gave up waiting and cleared its
callbacks.

At some point this got removed from 0.8+.  (Or possibly never got correctly
merged upwards.)  Let's fix this.

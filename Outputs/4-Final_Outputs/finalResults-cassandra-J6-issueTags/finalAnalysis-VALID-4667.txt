Description: 

Currently you need a restart of Cassandra to load a changed access.properties file. This
is very annoying. The patch changes the behaviour of SimpleAuthority to match the
behaviour of SimpleAuthenticator.

Patch to change the behaviour 


New Comment: 
Is this supposed to add auto-reloading-without-restart?  If so, I don't see how it
accomplishes that. 


New Comment: 
Like in SimpleAuthenticator the properties-file is loaded on every request. If that is not
OK I can change the patch in a way to check the lastModified-timestamp of the
property-file.<br/>If we do that we should change SimpleAuthenticator as well. 


New Comment: 
Ah, I see.  That's fine, it's intended more as a demo than anything.  Committed.

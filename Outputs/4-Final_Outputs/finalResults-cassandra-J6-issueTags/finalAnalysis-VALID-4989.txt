Description: 

If JMX times out it's difficult to tell when repair completes.Right now we log at DEBUG
for each column family but we need a way to tell when the repair operation completes as a
whole.

Attached patch adds two new log messages:<ul>	<li>at the completion of a repair session.
This part is already in 1.0.0 but not in 0.8.</li>	<li>at the beginning and total
completion of a repair "command". A command being basically a 'nodetool repair' call, that
usually consist of multiple session (one by token range).</li></ul>

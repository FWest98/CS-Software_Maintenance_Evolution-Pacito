Description: 

Kris Hahn discovered a python2.6-ism in recent cqlsh changes:
<div class="code panel"
style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent"><pre class="code-java">  
     bval = escapedval.encode(output_encoding, errors=<span
class="code-quote">'backslashreplace'</span>)</pre></div></div>
before python2.7,
str.encode() didn't accept a keyword argument for the second parameter. the semantics are
the same without naming the parameter, though, so removing the "errors=" bit should
suffice to make it run right.

does not affect any released version, but does affect HEAD
of cassandra-1.0, cassandra-1.1, and trunk.

New Comment: 
edit: this is also a problem on python2.6, not just python2.5. resolution is still the
same.

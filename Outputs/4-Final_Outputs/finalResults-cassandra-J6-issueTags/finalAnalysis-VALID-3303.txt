Description: 

This can be observed by watching how much the row/key cache grows on each run.  I'm not
sure when this started or if it was always the case, but it's actually useful behavior
when you want to benchmark just the cache, so it'd be nice to preserve as an option.

New Comment: 
can't we use stdev instead of adding another option? 


New Comment: 
there was a small mistake in the guassian distribution algorithm which is fixed now (also
-r flag wasn't parsed correctly, which is fixed too). 


New Comment: 
Committed.

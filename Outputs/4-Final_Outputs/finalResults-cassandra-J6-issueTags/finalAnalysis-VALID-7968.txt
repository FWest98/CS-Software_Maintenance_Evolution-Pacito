Description: 

The following cqlsh code appears to do nothing.
<div class="code panel"
style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent"><pre
class="code-java">alter table blah with compaction_strategy_class =
‘LeveledCompactionStrategy’;</pre></div></div>
It completes as though it worked but when
you describe the table, it's still STCS.

New Comment: 
It's not a cqlsh issue. It's a CQL2 AlterTableStatement bug. Affects CQL2 1.1 and 1.2.
Doesn't affect CQL3 in either C* version.

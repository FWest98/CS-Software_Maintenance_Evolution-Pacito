Description: 

With improvements like leveled compaction and <a

at read time (&quot;superseding / defragmenting&quot;)" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-2503"><del>CASSANDRA-2503</del></a> it's no longer worth
throwing quite so much memory at BF to avoid false positives.

New Comment: 
attached.(to avoid messing with pre-upgrade CF definitions, I've moved the default code
out of CFM.init.  CreateColumnFamilyStatement already checks the default, so that just
left CassandraServer to update.)

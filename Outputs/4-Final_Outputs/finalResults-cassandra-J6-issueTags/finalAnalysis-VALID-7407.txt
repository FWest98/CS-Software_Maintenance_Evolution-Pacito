Description: 

It's clear at this point that <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2045" title="Simplify HH to decrease
read load when nodes come back" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-2045"><del>CASSANDRA-2045</del></a> greatly reduced the impact
of storing hints for a dead node.  Let's increase the default window to make full AES
repair that much less necessary.

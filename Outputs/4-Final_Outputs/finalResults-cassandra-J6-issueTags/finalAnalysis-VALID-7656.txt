Description: 

I don't have a good way to test this directly, but I'm concerned the Uri parsing for
widerows isn't going to work.  setLocation <br/>1.) calls setLocationFromUri (which sets
widerows to the Uri value)<br/>2.) sets widerows to a static value (which is defined as
false)<br/>3.) sets widerows to the system setting if it exists.  <br/>That doesn't seem
right...

But setLocationFromUri also gets called from setStoreLocation, and I don't
really know the difference between setLocation and setStoreLocation in terms of what is
going on in terms of the integration between cassandra/pig/hadoop.

New Comment: 
You're right.  Patch attached to instead init the vars as default, then parse from the
uri, and finally allow overriding with env vars. 


New Comment: 
+1 to the changes, though don't we want to expose a way for them to set those variables
with standard hadoop config, possibly namespaced with pig?  e.g. cassandra.pig.wide.row? 


New Comment: 
I was looking at 1.1.5 that didn't yet have the URL location for Cassandra accepting the
widerows or use_secondary flags.  That's in there in the 1.1 branch.in other words +1 <img

Description: 

default page_size of 10000 is huge, and makes it impossible to set a
hinted_handoff_throttle_delay_in_ms that works well for both wide rows and narrow.

at the
same time you don't want to make it TOO small because that will hurt performance on the
source node (seeking to the hinted row repeatedly).

Description: 

The WordCount example shows how to use client.batch_mutate, and has a helper method for
building a mutation map. While the example works properly, the example addToMutationMap is
flawed in that it won't allow adding of multiple columns to the same row, as is what is
needed to perform a 'sql like insert' operation, which is the most likely example someone
learning cassandra will want to do. Fixed the sample addToMutationMap code so that it
works correctly for multi column inserts in one 'row'.

Description: 

<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2882" title="describe_ring
should include datacenter/topology information" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-2882"><del>CASSANDRA-2882</del></a> broke describe_ring by
causing the 'endpoints' field to contain the rpc address rather than the listen address.
the rpc_address belongs in the 'rpc_endpoints' field. Hence the name.

Fixes the bug as well as adding rack information. 


New Comment: 
Didn't change the thrift version number in that patch. Assuming it is committed, that
should also be bumped.

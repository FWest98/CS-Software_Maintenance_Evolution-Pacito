Description: 

Various patches in the Pig Storage Handler:
<ul class="alternate"
type="square">	<li>correctly guess the right Pig type for the Row Key</li>	<li>add support
for FloatType, DoubleType, <del>UUIDType (as String) and DateType (as time epoch)</del>
(removed in v2 because it would break when storing data back in Cassandra)</li>	<li>add
support to specify correct type comparator in SlicePredicate</li></ul>
<b>SlicePredicate
comparator:</b><br/>For instance:
<blockquote>
<tt>raw =  LOAD
'cassandra://ks/cf?slice_start=2.5&amp;slice_end=5.3&amp;comparator=DoubleType' USING
CassandraStorage() AS ();</tt>
</blockquote>
It's an optional parameter. If it's not
present, it will default to BytesType. Which mean you must use hex strings.<br/>Hence
<tt>slice_start=00&amp;slice_end=FF</tt> isn't the same as
<tt>slice_start=00&amp;slice_end=FF&amp;comparator=AsciiType</tt> !

New Comment: 
Removes Date and UUID transformation, as it could pose problems when storing data back in
Cassandra.

New Comment: 
+1Wouldn't it make sense to also merge to trunk with 1.7 there? This is not necessary I
suppose, but this would make it clear that it's how the release will be done. And once we
start using 1.7 only features, maybe it'll provide a more meaningful error message? 


New Comment: 
yes i will.. just that in trunk it will be (eventually) 1.7

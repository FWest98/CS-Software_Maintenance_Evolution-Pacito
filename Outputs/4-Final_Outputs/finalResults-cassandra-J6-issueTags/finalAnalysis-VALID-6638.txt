Description: 

The stress tool hangs forever if it encounters a timeout or exception. CTRL-C will kill
it if run from a terminal, but when running it from a script (like a dtest) it hangs the
script forever. It would be great for scripting it if a reasonable error code was returned
when things go wrong.

To duplicate, clear out /var/lib/cassandra and then run "stress
--operation=READ".

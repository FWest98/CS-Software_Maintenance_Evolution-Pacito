Removing the 'final' in 'final class'. Made with ack -l 'final class' src/ | xargs sed -i
'' 's/final class/class/'. (Substituting grep for ack in there should work.) 


New Comment: 
My review is that this patch is, indeed, awesome.  That is my review.  I've got a fever,
and the only prescription is more of this patch.

Description: 

All uses of the <tt>ASSUME</tt> command in cqlsh now appear to be wholly ineffective at
affecting subsequent value output.

This is due to a change in the grammar definition
introduced by the fix for <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4198"
title="cqlsh: update recognized syntax for cql3" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-4198"><del>CASSANDRA-4198</del></a>, upon which definition the
ASSUME functionality relied.

All that's needed to fix is to update the token-binding
names used.

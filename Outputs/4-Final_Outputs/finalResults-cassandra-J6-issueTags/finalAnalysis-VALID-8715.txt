Description: 

Provide a nodetool command to run repairs for subranges

It appears that the machinery to
do this is already present and can be run through JMX 

StorageService:<br/>public
AntiEntropyService.RepairFuture forceTableRepair(final Range&lt;Token&gt; range, final
String tableName, boolean isSequential, final String... columnFamilies)

New Comment: 
Patch adds the needed options to nodetool, however it looks like something is wrong with
repairing specific ranges.  Passing start/end that aren't token boundaries results in the
node saying there are no neighbors to repair with, but passing tokens on the boundary does
work. 


New Comment: 
Patch lgtm, +1.<br/>Also attaching patch to fix subrange problem. 


New Comment: 
v2 incorporates the getNeighbors fix, and also catches the IAE and returns an error if the
range crosses nodes.

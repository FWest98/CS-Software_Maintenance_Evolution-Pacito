Description: 

The README.txt file states "Run `ant` from the Cassandra source directory, then Run `ant`
from the contrib/stress directory."

The file needs to reflect the changes in the way
stress is built.

New Comment: 
I vote that the readme should mention the need to run 'ant jar' or 'ant stress-build' 


New Comment: 
I suggest that it's time we made 'ant jar' the default target instead. 


New Comment: 
+1 ant jar should be the default target.

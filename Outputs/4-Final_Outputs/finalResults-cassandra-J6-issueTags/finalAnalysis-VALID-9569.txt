Description: 

Storage proxy includes some logger.trace methods that should be Tracing.trace, and more
logger.trace that aren't useful.

Also QueryProcessor is not consistent about logging what
it is executing and should include ConsistencyLevel.

Comments: 

New Comment: 
lgtm, +1.Nit: for consistency sake, we could start with a caps in<div class="preformatted
panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent"><pre>not
hinting {} which has been down {}ms</pre></div></div>Also, could be more user friendly to
include the time after which we start not hinting.

Description: 

It is currently possible to "describe tables" to list the tables in the current keyspace,
or list all tables in all keyspaces if you are not currently in a keyspace. It is also
possible to enumerate the keyspaces with a cql command to select from the
system.schema_columnfamilies. There should be a simple "describe keyspaces" command that
enumerates just the keyspaces and is syntactic sugar for "select keyspace name from
schema_keyspaces".

Description: 

Currently Pig only understands composite columns not composite row keys.

Support for
querying column family that has composite type for its key_validation_class will be nice.

I've create a first version to support this in the attached patch.This is a patch against
the git mirror. Please let me know if there are things that need to be done differently. I
didn't see any tests for CassandraStorage, so therefore didn't add any for this. 


New Comment: 
I think this is only going to work for reading, but not writing.We don't have any unit
tests for CS, but there are end-to-end tests in examples/pig/test where we usually try to
test the 'copy CF' scenario for various types. 


New Comment: 
You're right yeah. I've checked, but the support for composite column types also doesn't
seem to support writing. I've added some tests for reading to examples/pig/test and those
work. Looking into adding some tests for writing for both composite column types and
composite keys so they both can work. 


New Comment: 
Support for reading composite row keys and add integration test 


New Comment: 
Add integration tests and support for writing composite values back into Cassandra 


New Comment: 
I've removed the original patch and added two new ones. One implements reading composite
keys and the other adds support for writing back Pig tuples into Cassandra.

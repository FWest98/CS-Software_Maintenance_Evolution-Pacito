Finally tracked this down on dtestbot after setting the rpc_timeout to ridiculous
levels:

node2 receives the goodbye
command from node3, and node1 has already marked node3 down, but some kind of signal is
still coming from node3 to node2 marking it up again.

New Comment: 
This is a pernicious thing to debug, since the timing condition is so tight; enabling
DEBUG or TRACE even on just the gossiper does not let it reproduce.  However, careful
examination of the INFO messages tells us that handleMajorStateChange is not being called
since there is no 'node restarted' message, which means applyStateLocally is the only
other option, and that is called in the ack/ack2 handlers. This tells us that we're in the
middle of a gossip round when we send the shutdown message, so the easiest thing to do is
sleep for more than one round.  Trivial patch to do so, which has solved this on the
dtests.

v2 adds just a touch more protection and ignores ack2 when gossip is disabled, which we
were already doing in ack/syn.

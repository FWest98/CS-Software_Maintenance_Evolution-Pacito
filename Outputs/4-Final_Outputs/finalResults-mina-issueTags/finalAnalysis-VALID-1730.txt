Description: 

A normal multi-session IoHandler can be added to the acceptor using the "addHandler"
method. However, when writing a single-session IoHandler I can't find any information
about how to register it with the acceptor. The "addHandler" method doesn't accept
single-session IoHandlers.

New Comment: 
Documentation will be fixed for 2.0-RC1 


New Comment: 
1 - These  classes are pretty well documented<br/>2 - They're badly named as the 'real
handler' is in fact the SingleSessionIoHandlerDelegate and not the
SingleSessionIoHandler.<br/>As we have freezed the API can we still rename these as it is
the source of the confusion ?<br/>3 - Is it really a good idea to provide this package as
it goes against scalability principles ? should we remove it completly ? for 2.0 ? 3.0 ?
or just document the fact that it can suffer scalability problems (which would be
compliant with api freeze) and maybe even mark these as deprecated ?WDYT ?

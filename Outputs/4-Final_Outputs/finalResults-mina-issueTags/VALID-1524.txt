Description: 

There has been enourmous demand for
supporting proxy such as simple port
forwarding and SOCKS.  We need to
investigate what the best way is to
provide an extension point for
proxies.

IoFilters are not adequate for
proxies because proxies needs changes in
the socket addresses (both local and
remote) of IoSession.

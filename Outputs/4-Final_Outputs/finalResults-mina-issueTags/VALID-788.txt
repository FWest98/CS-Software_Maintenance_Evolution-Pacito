Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-269 (Cancellation operation for ConnectFuture)
    * Added ConnectFuture.cancel()
    * Added cancellation feature to NioSocketConnector
    * Other connector implementations don't need for cancellation operation effectively, so no change has been made.
    * Added AbstractIoConnector.finishSessionInitialization() to remove code duplication

Description: 

Currently I'm using the following logic
to connect to server

ConnectFuture
future = socket.connect(SocketAddress,
IoHandler);<br/>future.join();<br/>try
{<br/>    session =
future.getSession();<br/>} catch
(Exception e) {<br/>    // e.getCause()
tells the error<br/>}

it waits till the
connection is established. but I want
the user to be able to stop the connect
process while it is not yet established.
for example in cases that
Connection_Timeout would occur, the user
should wait till the time out is
finished. is it possible to stop it
whenever we desire?

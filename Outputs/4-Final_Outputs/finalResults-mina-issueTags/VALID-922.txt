Description: 

As discussed here: <a

For
now, we use String to identify event
types, which is somewhat unsafe.  Using
an enum might be useful, but there are a
few disadvantages:
<ul>	<li>Wildcard
event type cannot be used, which could
be extended further (e.g. "message*" or
"session(Opened|Closed)")</li></ul>
Probably
sticking to String might be the best
solution? <img class="emoticon"

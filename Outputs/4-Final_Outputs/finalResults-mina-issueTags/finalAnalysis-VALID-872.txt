Description: 

Some errors of ProtocolDecoder are recoverable and others are not.  In 1.x, there was no
way to represent a recoverable decoder error that allows the ProtocolCodecFilter to keep
calling the decoder.

We could subclass ProtocolDecoderException, so that
ProtocolCodecFilter can decide to keep calling the decoder or stop.

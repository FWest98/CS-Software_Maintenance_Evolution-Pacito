Description: 

<a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRMINA-362"
title="Channel writes being made without
OP_WRITE selector ready"
class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="DIRMINA-362"><del>DIRMINA-362</del></a>
introduced seriously slow write
throughput in a certain situation. 
Removing the added if block immediately
boosted write throughput up.  Instead of
the problematic if statement, I added
channel.isConnected() check before the
write loop in SocketIoProcessor.

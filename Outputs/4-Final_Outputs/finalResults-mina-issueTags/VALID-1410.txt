Description: 

I have developed an HTTP Routing server
using Mina 1.0.9 and I am using
SSLFilter for handling SSL
Connections.

1. Using Jmeter as the
client I am sending HTTPS requests to
this server with 5 threads.<br/>2. For
some of the requests(10%) the
sessionCreated method on the Handler is
getting called and the data from the
client is not read by the server.<br/>3.
sessionIdle() gets triggered and we
close the connection. 

This happens for
the ssl connections only and when the
server is trying to resume the cached
session.

I enabled ssl debug using
-Djavax.net.debug=all on the server and
I got the following logs for the failed
sessions

Any
ideas why this could happen?

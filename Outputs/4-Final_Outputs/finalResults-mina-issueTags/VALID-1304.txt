commit 02e2624c0adb669647525fab51d13d88b39221be
Author: Mark Webb <mwebb@apache.org>

    Added granularity to the connection timeout.  The timeout was measured in seconds and is not measured in milliseconds.  Sangjin Lee provided a patch (DIRMINA-527) and I reviewed the patch.  The set/get ConnectionTimeout in AbstractPollingIoConnector that handled the seconds instead of milliseconds are being deprecated with a note to use milliseconds.  This makes sense to me and in my opinion does not take away from the robust set of methods for connectors.

Description: 

Currently, IoConnector allows setting
connect timeouts only in seconds.  The
minimum value of allowed connect timeout
is 1 second.  There are cases where one
needs to have a shorter connect timeout
than 1 second and will finer granularity
than seconds.

I suggest introducing the
ability to set connect timeout in
milliseconds and deprecating the
getter/setter in seconds in favor of the
ms getter/setter.

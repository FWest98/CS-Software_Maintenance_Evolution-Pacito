Description: 

As discussed here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2omrl9" class="external-link"

For now, we use String to identify event
types, which is somewhat unsafe.  Using an enum might be useful, but there are a few
disadvantages:
<ul>	<li>Wildcard event type cannot be used, which could be extended
further (e.g. "message*" or "session(Opened|Closed)")</li></ul>
Probably sticking to
String might be the best solution? <img class="emoticon"

New Comment: 
I've introduced IoHandlerEvents and IoFilterEvents which enumerate the possible events for
the IoHandler and IoFilter interfaces. I've also added IoHandlerTransition and
IoFilterTransition annotations. When used the events for the on annotation parameter
aren't strings but instead come from either IoHandlerEvents or IoFilterEvents.
StateMachine.createForIoHandler() should be used to create a StateMachine which uses the
IoHandlerTransition annotation. See the TapeDeck example for a demonstration.PS:
Annotations in Java are extremely limited. For example you cannot have null as a default
value for a parameter. This is why I found it impossible to use IoEventType from mina-core
and had to introduce IoHandlerEvents (my first idea was to use null for the wildcard
event). Furthermore enums cannot be extended which is why IoFilterEvents redefines all the
events which are also in IoHandlerEvents. In don't like code duplication but I didn't have
a choice this time. <img class="emoticon"

New Comment: 
Excellent!  and a few tiny comments... <img class="emoticon"
src="https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png" height="16"
width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>1) We are now tightly-coupled with
mina-core.  Are you sure about this?<br/>2) WDYT about removing FILTER_ prefix to get
aligned with org.apache.mina.common.IoEventType? 


New Comment: 
1) Just checked in a fix for this. There are now MINA specific versions of
StateMachineFactory.<br/>2) Fixed!I'm not sure I like how 1) turned out. There are lots of
code duplication there. Maybe if we changed StateMachineFactory so that it isn't all
static like now and to obtain one you would always have to specifiy the annotations to be
used like so:StateMachineFactory.getInstance(IoHandlerTransition.class).create(...)We need
a way to couple IoHandlerTransition and IoHandlerTransitions together. I think we can use
a special annotation for that:@TransitionsCombiner(IoHandlerTransitions.class)<br/>public
interface @IoHandlerTransition {<br/>...<br/>}That way you won't have to specifiy both
IoHandlerTransition and IoHandlerTransitions in the call to getInstance(...).WDYT? 


New Comment: 
&gt; We need a way to couple IoHandlerTransition and IoHandlerTransitions together. I
think we can use a special annotation for that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;
@TransitionsCombiner(IoHandlerTransitions.class)<br/>&gt; public interface
@IoHandlerTransition {&gt; ...&gt; } Does this mean we apply the same technique to
IoFilterTransition(s) and Transition(s)?  Then it sounds great to me.  Probably we could
allow user to specify either annotation
class:StateMachineFactory.getInstance(IoHandlerTransition.class).create(...) =
StateMachineFactory.getInstance(IoHandlerTransitions.class).create(...)Does it make a
sense?

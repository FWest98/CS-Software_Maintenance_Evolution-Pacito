commit fa289f636f85c0f9de72cb35ea511fdf75e73df9
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-292 (Shared I/O Processors)
    * Added SimpleIoProcessorPool which provides common simple round-robin distribution of IoProcessors
    * Made all IoProcessor implementations public so that SimpleIoProcessorPool can access them
    * Changed all acceptor and connector implementations to accept IoProcessor (including SimpleIoProcessorPool), which natually resolves the 'shared I/O processors' issue.
    * Applied Java 5 Generics to IoProcessor

Description: 

Currently, I/O processor threads belong
to its parent IoService, which means
that I/O processors cannot be shared
among different services.  This becomes
a serious issue when more than one
service is deployed into the same JVM. 
Therefore, we need a way to share the
I/O processors among the services with
the same transport type.

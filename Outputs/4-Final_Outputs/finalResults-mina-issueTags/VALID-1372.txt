Description: 

Current KeepAliveFilter implementation
forwards all sessionIdle events to the
next filter regardless it's processed by
the KeepAliveFilter or not. 
KeepAliveFilter only handles
sessionIdle(READER_IDLE), so
sessionIdle(WRITER_IDLE) and
sessionIdle(BOTH_IDLE) should be
forwardrd to the next filter while
sessionIdle(READER_IDLE) shouldn't.

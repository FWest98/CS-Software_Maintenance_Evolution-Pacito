Description: 

As JDK provides BufferedOutputStream,
we could provide BufferingFilteer which
does the same thing, which buffers
encoded data and flushes it out when the
buffer becomes full or the flush
operation is explicitly requested.  This
kind of filter is sometimes useful when
a session is generating very small
messages too frequently and consequently
generates unnecessary traffic overhead.

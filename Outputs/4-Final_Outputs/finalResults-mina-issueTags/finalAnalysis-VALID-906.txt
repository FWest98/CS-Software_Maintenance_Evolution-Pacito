Description: 

<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRMINA-362" title="Channel writes being
made without OP_WRITE selector ready" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="DIRMINA-362"><del>DIRMINA-362</del></a> introduced seriously slow write
throughput in a certain situation.  Removing the added if block immediately boosted write
throughput up.  Instead of the problematic if statement, I added channel.isConnected()
check before the write loop in SocketIoProcessor.

Description: 

Currently, I/O processor threads belong
to its parent IoService, which means
that I/O processors cannot be shared
among different services.  This becomes
a serious issue when more than one
service is deployed into the same JVM. 
Therefore, we need a way to share the
I/O processors among the services with
the same transport type.

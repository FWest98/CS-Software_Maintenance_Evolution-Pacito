Description: 

MINA now has basic support for
suspending/resuming reads and writes on
an IoSession for all transport types. We
should use this feature to implement a
traffic shaping filter which lets the
user configure bandwidth limitations.
Both globally and for individual
sessions. Here are some configuration
options I can come to think
of:
<ul>	<li>Globally specify a maximum
data rate for individual sessions (e.g.
max 10 kb/s for all
sessions).</li>	<li>Specify a maximum
data rate on a per session basis (e.g.
max 1 Mb/s for a particular
session).</li>	<li>Specify a maximum
upper limit on the bandwidth used by all
sessions in total (e.g. all sessions
share a total of 10
Mb/s).</li>	<li>Configure different
traffic classes with different limits to
allow for high/low priority traffic and
partition sessions into these priority
classes.</li></ul>
I'm not sure how
advanced it would have to be so please
share your thoughts. Maybe point 1 and 2
would suffice? I think 3 and 4 add a lot
of complexity since they need some kind
of scheduling algorithm to provide
fairness between sessions.

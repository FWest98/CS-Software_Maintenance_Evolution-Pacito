Description: 

A call to session.close() does not send
a FIN packet althought MINA will
considers the session as closed.

I've
attached two test cases, one that works
with MINA 1.1 (and works fine) and other
with MINA 2.0 that doesn't close
connections.

This is a simple echo
server that receives a message, writes
it back to the client and (should) close
the connection. 

This problem is
<b>NOT</b> ocurring on Linux where the
same test case works fine. It only shows
up on Mac OS X.

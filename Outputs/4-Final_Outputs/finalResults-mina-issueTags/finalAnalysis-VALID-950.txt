Description: 

Currently, I/O processor threads belong to its parent IoService, which means that I/O
processors cannot be shared among different services.  This becomes a serious issue when
more than one service is deployed into the same JVM.  Therefore, we need a way to share
the I/O processors among the services with the same transport type.

New Comment: 
Updated issue description; I think it is too difficult to provide sharing for acceptor and
connector threads other than I/O processors.  So I just narrowed down the scope of this
issue.  Moreover, what's most critical part if sharing I/O processors.  The acceptor and
connector threads are not that busy to cause contention IMHO, and it will be no problem at
all once <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRMINA-341" title="Allow binding
multiple SocketAddresses per IoAcceptor." class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="DIRMINA-341"><del>DIRMINA-341</del></a> is resolved.

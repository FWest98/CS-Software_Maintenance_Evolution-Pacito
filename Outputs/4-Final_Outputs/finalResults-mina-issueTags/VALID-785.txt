Description: 

The SocketConnection cannot be closed.
Currently it will wait a certain amount
of timeout as specified by the worker
timeout to shut down the connection.
This can result in OOM and hanging
clients until the timeouts occur. Mina
should allow the SocketConnection to be
closed manually if the connection is
known to be completed.

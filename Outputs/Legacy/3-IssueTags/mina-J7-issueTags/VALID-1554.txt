commit d1667c18bddf6527aa8a920db7947489fcb4fe53
Author: Emmanuel Lecharny <elecharny@apache.org>

    o Added Javadoc and comments
    o The encoder/decoder are now stored into the session, instead of being created on the fly.
    o Added a sessionCreated() handler to create the encoder/decoder when the session is created
    o Removed the useless getEncoder0() and getDecoder0() methods.
    o Added defensive tests to avoid a NPE if the encoders/decoders are not present in the session
    o The messageReceive() should loop until there are no more bytes to decode, instead of just getting out. Aded a TODO: check this part
    o Modified the chat example to inject the codec filter before creating the session.

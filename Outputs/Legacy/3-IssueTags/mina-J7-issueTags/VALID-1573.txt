commit c5c60494a6e3dcc8661868939bdb5c3dbaf34470
Author: Emmanuel Lecharny <elecharny@apache.org>

    o Removed some dead code
    o Added a select() method without timeout for the IoProcessor
    o Replaced a call to select(1000) by a call to select(), as there are no reason we should stop the select process every second.

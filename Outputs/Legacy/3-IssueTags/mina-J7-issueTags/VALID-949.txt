commit fa289f636f85c0f9de72cb35ea511fdf75e73df9
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-292 (Shared I/O Processors)
    * Added SimpleIoProcessorPool which provides common simple round-robin distribution of IoProcessors
    * Made all IoProcessor implementations public so that SimpleIoProcessorPool can access them
    * Changed all acceptor and connector implementations to accept IoProcessor (including SimpleIoProcessorPool), which natually resolves the 'shared I/O processors' issue.
    * Applied Java 5 Generics to IoProcessor

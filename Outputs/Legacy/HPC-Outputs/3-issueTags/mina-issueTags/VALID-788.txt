commit 4d70edfd3d05297e15cd8ff23b02b86b0e31254c
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-269 (Cancellation operation for ConnectFuture)
    * Added ConnectFuture.cancel()
    * Added cancellation feature to NioSocketConnector
    * Other connector implementations don't need for cancellation operation effectively, so no change has been made.
    * Added AbstractIoConnector.finishSessionInitialization() to remove code duplication

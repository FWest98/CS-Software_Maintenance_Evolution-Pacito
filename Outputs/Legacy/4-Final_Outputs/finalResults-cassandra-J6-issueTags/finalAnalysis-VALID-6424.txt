Description: 

If a user attempts to list a column family from the CLI that contains a wide-row (e.g. 10
million columns).  It crashes hangs the CLI and then Cassandra eventually crashes with an
OoM.  We should introduce a default limit on columns when listing a column family.

New Comment: 
Here is a patch that does for column limit what we already had in place for limitCount
(rows). 


New Comment: 
You can use the test_data.cl file to test the patch.  Run it:<br/>bin/cassandra-cli -h
localhost &lt; bin/data.cdl The list column family
foo:bone@zen:~/git/boneill42/cassandra-&gt; echo -e "use test;\r\n list foo;" |
bin/cassandra-cli -h localhost | wc -l<br/>     117It should be &lt; 150. 


New Comment: 
thanks. my boneheaded mistake... looks good to me.

Description: 

When using CassandraStorage in a Pig script that runs in a Hadoop cluster, the
environment variable configuration option for allow_deletes doesn't work.  I'd like to see
allow_deletes added as a URL parameter.

For example, I'd like to do<br/>STORE
storable_events INTO 'cassandra://drlcrs/event?allow_deletes=true' USING
org.apache.cassandra.hadoop.pig.CassandraStorage();

New Comment: 
No unit tests available yet - I'm not sure how to test the URL or failure cases by looking
at the existing tests.  I'll have to dig a little more. 


New Comment: 
I've submitted trunk-4499.txt which is missing unit tests but is what I'm looking for so
that allow_deletes can be set without using environment variables.

<blockquote>No unit tests available yet - I'm not sure how to test the URL or failure

should be able to just insert empty tuples in the tests in examples/pig.While we're at it,
maybe we should move the wide row flag to the url too. 


New Comment: 
v2 also allows setting widerow and secondary index mode with url params.

New Comment: 
Can you give an example of a classpath where quoting breaks it?  It definitely works as-is
for me right now.  I believe the purpose of the quoting is to allow paths with spaces,
like the common C:\Program Files. 


New Comment: 
Right we want to quote the classpath but it is currently getting double quoted which
breaks things on windows. When we loop over the jars in the lib dir and call the ':append'
block we pass each jar quoted. Then later we quote the entire classpath again when we call
java. So we end up with:<div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div
class="preformattedContent panelContent"><pre>""jar1";"jar2";"jar3""</pre></div></div>That
will actually break if any of those jars have spaces in the path. 


New Comment: 
I see what you mean.  v2 attached to generalize fix to other .bats. 


New Comment: 
lgtm.Tested all tools with a space in the classpath.

New Comment: 
wasted a lot of time trying to plot the compression ratio's in cfhistogram finally trashed
that implementation for a simple cfstat output which will be average of compression
ratio's.In the output anything over 1.x is bad. 


New Comment: 
Looks just fine but needs rebase so I can test everything - 0001 patch does not apply... 


New Comment: 
rebased with the latest trunk. Thanks! 


New Comment: 
Committed. 


New Comment: 
Reverting temporarily until we can get <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3470" title="Add a second letter to
Descriptor version" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-3470"><del>CASSANDRA-3470</del></a> in.  Bumping a "full"
revision would break streaming within a minor release series and we don't want to do that. 


New Comment: 
Realized <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3470" title="Add a
second letter to Descriptor version" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-3470"><del>CASSANDRA-3470</del></a> isn't sufficient by itself,
added <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3478" title="Add support
for sstable forwards-compatibility" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-3478"><del>CASSANDRA-3478</del></a>. 


New Comment: 
Okay, those are both committed to 1.0 branch.  Can you rebase with a new sstable version
of "hb"? 


New Comment: 
Rebased... Thanks!

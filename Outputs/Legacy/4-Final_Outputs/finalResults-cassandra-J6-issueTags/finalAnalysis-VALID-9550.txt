Description: 

Currently we have two instances of the "use the local ip inside the same datacenter
trick":
<ul>	<li>Ec2MultiRegionSnitch &#8211; which is obviously EC2
specific</li>	<li>YamlFileNetworkTopologySnitch &#8211; which is powerful but
verbose</li></ul>
There is no reason that GossipingPropertyFileSnitch could not
(optionally) do the same.  Attached is a patch that adds a preferLocal
(default==false==current-behavior) property to GossipingPropertyFileSnitch and does the
IEndpointStateChangeSubscriber reconnect dance.  I based it on the other snitches but
admit that they still seem fairly magical to me.  This could be a new class that extends
GossipingPropertyFileSnitch, but I could not think of a name that wasn't absurdly long.

Description: 

DropKeyspace assumes that the Table had been open (rather, it checks that Table.clear()
don't return null). It has been seen however that in the case of a fat client (the
sstableloader in that case, but it would be true for any fat client) the Table may not
have been open. Let's just remove that assertion.

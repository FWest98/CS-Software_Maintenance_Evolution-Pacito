Description: 

Cqlsh provides context-sensitive tab-completion functionality, but it's only available
when the readline library is available, and this is not the case where readline's GPL
license proves problematic. <a href="http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/"
class="external-link" rel="nofollow">libedit</a> is a common replacement, which would be
available to Mac OS X-bundled Python users, and the Python readline module makes libedit
almost a drop-in replacement.

If possible, fallback to libedit functionality when
providing tab completion.

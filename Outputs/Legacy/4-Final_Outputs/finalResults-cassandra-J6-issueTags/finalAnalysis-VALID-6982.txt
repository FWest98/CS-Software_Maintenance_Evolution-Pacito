Description: 

On Windows the tools either don't work at all (cassandra-stress) and/or litter the shell
environment (cassandra-stress &amp; sstablemetadata) by repeatedly appending the same
information to variables, eventually running out of space.

New Comment: 
Trivial fixes for tools to consistently find the right classes and not litter the
environment. 


New Comment: 
Does stress work for you with these changes?  I still get "Could not find the main class:
org.apache.cassandra.stress.Stress." 


New Comment: 
Yes, everything runs for me (I just re-tested): start cassandra node on localhost, open
second shell in ../tools/bin, run cassandra-stress.bat, it goes to work. I made these
changes directly in the unpacked 1.1.1 distro tree. The main problem was that resolving
"*.jar" as single string did not work for the stress.jar, so it was never found. The other
.bat scripts do the same find-append loop, as well as the setlocal.

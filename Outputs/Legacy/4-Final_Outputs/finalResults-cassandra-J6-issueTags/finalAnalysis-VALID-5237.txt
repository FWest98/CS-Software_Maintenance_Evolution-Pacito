Description: 

{{<br/><span class="error">&#91;root@Apture&#93;</span> update column family MagicLinks
with min_compaction_threshold=1 and
max_compaction_threshold=20;<br/>b98e3b80-f3a3-11e0-0000-76abb4a6dbbf<br/>Waiting for
schema agreement...<br/>... schemas agree across the cluster<br/>}}

I'm told that a
min_compaction_threshold of 1 is nonsensical.  I had a spell where my servers stopped
doing compactions.  Once I upped the min_compaction_threshold, they started compacting
again.  I'm unable to confirm for sure that this was the case.

ISTM the easiest thing to do here is actually use 2 when a user specifies 1. 


New Comment: 
I'd rather raise an error server-side, than silently not do what was requested

New Comment: 
Needed this – works for me w/ SimpleAuthenticator – picked 'setOutputKeyspaceUserName' as
there is no setInputKeyspaceUserName<br/>To test:<br/>Set the environment variables to
your username<br/>+ public final static String PIG_USERNAME = "PIG_USERNAME";<br/>+ public
final static String PIG_PASSWORD = "PIG_PASSWORD";

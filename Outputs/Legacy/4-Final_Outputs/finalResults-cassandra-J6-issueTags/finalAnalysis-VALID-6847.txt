Description: 

the long-test fails:
<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div
class="codeContent panelContent"><pre class="code-java">BUILD
FAILED/home/tahooie/datastax/cassandra/build.xml:1125: Problem: failed to create task or
type jvmargCause: The name is undefined.</pre></div></div>
The problem is that the
build.xml file has the jvmarg outside the &lt;testmacro&gt; tag instead of inside it. A
patch is forthcoming.

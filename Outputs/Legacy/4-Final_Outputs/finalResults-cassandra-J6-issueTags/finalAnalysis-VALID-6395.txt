Description: 

The default key cache of 2MB is significantly smaller than &lt;= 1.0 (200 rows per CF)
and much smaller than most production uses.  How about min(5% of the heap, 100MB)?

New Comment: 
+1 with nit: I prefer "auto".equalsIgnoreCase(conf.key_cache_size_in_mb) to avoid NPE in
case someone misconfigures value. 


New Comment: 
It's not really necessary because default value to "key_cache_size_in_mb" is set in the
Config class to "auto" so there is not chance it would be NPE. 


New Comment: 
You can override (accidentally) by setting empty value in cassandra.yaml. In that case,
you get null. 


New Comment: 
Hm, I didn't know that, thanks! 


New Comment: 
As a side note, so far we've avoided "auto" by saying that if the value is not set then we
use whatever default we decided (typically see memtable_total_space_in_mb or
memtable_flush_writers). It would be more consistent to use the same convention here.

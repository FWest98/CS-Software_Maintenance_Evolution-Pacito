Description: 

On the CLI if you do a 'describe cluster;' it would be really nice to have different
versions on different lines or some way to call out multiple versions more.  Right now
it's a UUID with a list of nodes for one, but with multiple versions, it's on the same
line - another UUID and another list of nodes.  That's hard to distinguish between one
version and multiple versions at a glance.

Description: 

Compaction type should be an enum, half of the places we set it we use it as a message
and include the keyspace/cf although that is already included in the compaction info
object.

I realize this is minor and a pedantic but from the standpoint of someone writing
a monitoring application its kind of annoying.

New Comment: 
committed with a couple fixes:<ul class="alternate" type="square">	<li>row cache save uses
correct enum</li>	<li>CompactionInfo.getTaskType returns enum instead of string so callers
don't have to do string inspection anymore</li></ul>

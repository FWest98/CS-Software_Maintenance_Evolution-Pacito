Description: 

cqlsh&gt; create keyspace test with strategy_class = 'SimpleStrategy' AND
strategy_options:replication_factor = 1;<br/>cqlsh&gt; use test;<br/>cqlsh:test&gt; create
table ts (id int primary key, ts timestamp);<br/>cqlsh:test&gt; insert into ts (id, ts)
values (1, '2012-05-14 07:53:20+0000');<br/>cqlsh:test&gt; select * from ts;<br/> id |
ts<br/>---<del>+</del>-------------------------<br/>  1 | 2012-05-14
10:53:20+0000

Should've been 2012-05-14 10:53:20+0300.

cqlsh formats timestamps using
'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z' format-string and 'the %z escape that expands to the preferred
hour/minute offset is not supported by all ANSI C libraries'. In this case it's just
replaced with all zeroes.

New Comment: 
Is there any reason not to put this in 1.1? 


New Comment: 
Not anymore. 


New Comment: 
Committed. 


New Comment: 
reopening because this was not merged to trunk.  (I got a conflict on merge so I just kept
the trunk version as a temporary fix.) 


New Comment: 
Huh? I have it in trunk. Seems like it was merged just fine.

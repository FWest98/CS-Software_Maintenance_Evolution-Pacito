Description: 

<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3079" title="Allow the client
request scheduler to throw Timeouts" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-3079"><del>CASSANDRA-3079</del></a> was very hasty, and
introduced two bugs that would: 1) cause the scheduler to busywait after a timeout, 2)
never actually throw timeouts. This calls for a test.

Title: [CASSANDRA-4893] Don't throw internal exceptions over JMX

Description: 

Similarly to how we don't return internal objects over JMX we shouldn't throw internal
exceptions over jmx as well.

The one example I encountered was throwing
ConfigurationException for the move() command. We should check the rest of our jmx as
well.

Patch is against 1.2 branch. It removes or cassandra related exceptions or replace them
with standard ones.<br/>It may be better to put this into 1.2.0 since it changes method
signatures which we don't want to do it in minor versions.

I want to get rc1 out really, really badly.  If you can expedite review of this <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=nickmbailey"
class="user-hover" rel="nickmbailey">Nick Bailey</a> that would be great.  Otherwise,
we've waited this long, it won't kill us to push it to 1.3. 


New Comment: 
doesn't doingthrow new IllegalArgumentException(e);still exhibit the problem of needing
the underlying exception class of 'e' in the classpath of the caller?it seems the thrown
exception needs to lose it's exception history. 


New Comment: 
Dave, thanks for review.<br/>Updated patch not to wrap cause and instead use just error
message. 


New Comment: 
Cassandra throws a few custom exceptions that are non-checked. Not sure if any of these
places can have these exceptions, but if the were, then we would still have bad exception
types going back to jmx. To be paranoid, catching just 'Exception' in these circumstances
would be needed. Don't know if this is a real issue tho.Some of these methods are used as
'real code' outside of jmx, and thus we are weakening the exception model in these spots.
Most of these look like client/tool code so i guess it's ok.nit: not a fan of dangling
statements after a try/catch-&gt;exit, as in setCompactionStrategyClass, i'd move
maybeReloadCompactionStrategy into the try.otherwise, if the above first issue, isn't an
issue... lgtm.

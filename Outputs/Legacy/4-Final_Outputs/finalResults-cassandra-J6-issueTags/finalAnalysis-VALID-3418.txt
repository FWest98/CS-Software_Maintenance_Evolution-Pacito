Description: 

stress currently produce fixed-size columns and values across rows, leading to unnatural
problems such as the memtables turning over at the same time on all nodes.  Instead these
could take standard deviation flags.

New Comment: 
ISTM that we could get 99% of the benefit here w/o too much complexity by decreeing that
column value sizes go from 0..2*size, i.e., average stays the same but you do get all
kinds of sizes in there.  I.e., I don't think I'm in favor of adding more options. 


New Comment: 
That sounds reasonable to me. 


New Comment: 
Does that mean that we should skip -S parameter (which sets the size of the value per
column)? Also, size from 0..2*size should be cardinality right (set by -C option)? 


New Comment: 
No, it means size should be 0..2*-S instead of exactly -S. 


New Comment: 
Doesn't actually help the memtable problem, but that's hard to do with an even cluster and
atypical anyway.  Committed to help with testing heap fragmentation with the cardinality
comment clarified.

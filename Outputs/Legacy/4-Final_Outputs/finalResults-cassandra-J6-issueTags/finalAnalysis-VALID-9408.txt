Description: 

DeletedColumn and RangeTombstone use the local-timestamp to update the digest during
repair.

Even though its only a second-precision timestamp, I think it still causes some
differences in the merkle tree, therefore causing overrepair.

I attached a patch on trunk
that adds a modified updateDigest() to DeletedColumn, which does not use the value field
for its calculation.

class="user-hover" rel="jbellis">Jonathan Ellis</a>: Would this ticket be a candidate for
1.2? It seems repair is getting a lot of attention lately, so there might be interest in
reducing overrepair whereever possible. 


New Comment: 
Sounds reasonable.  (Also, I hit Submit Patch which is what marks it ready for review.)

Description: 

Hello, 

using: bin/cassandra-cli -host localhost --file conf/schema-sample.txt

with
schema-sample.txt having contents like this:

/* here are a lot of comments,<br/>like this
sample create keyspace;<br/>and so on<br/>*/

Will result in an error: <br/>Line 1 =&gt;
Syntax Error at Position 323: mismatched charackter '&lt;EOF&gt;' expecting '*'

The Cause
is the keyspace; statement =&gt; the semicolon ";" causes the error.

However:

Writing
the word "keyspace;" with quotes, does NOT lead to the error.<br/>so this works: <br/>/*
here are a lot of comments,<br/>like this sample create "keyspace;"<br/>and so
on<br/>*/

From my point of view this is an error. Everyting between the "Start Comment"
=&gt; /* and "End Comment" =&gt; */ Should be treated as a comment and not be interpreted
in any way. Thats the definition of a comment, to be not interpreted at all. 

Or this
must be documented somewhere very prominently, otherwise this will lead to unnecessary
wasting of time searching for this odd behavoiur. And it makes "commenting out" statements
much more cumbersome.

Plattform: Windows Vista

thanks

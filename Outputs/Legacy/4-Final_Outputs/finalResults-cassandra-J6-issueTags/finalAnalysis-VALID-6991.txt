Description: 

Would like to be able to import data from a comma-delimited or tab-delimited file, one
"row" per line.  (That is, "row" can be "logical row" as in <a

New Comment: 
I'm fine doing this over python/cql, since we already ship that driver in-tree for cqlsh. 
I also don't think it needs to be ultra-high-performance, since by exporting it to a text
file first you're basically implying that<ol>	<li>performance isn't super critical, or
you'd write a custom source -&gt; cassandra loader and skip the intermediate text file
step</li>	<li>you're not concerned with huge data volumes</li></ol>So basically our target
use case is "want to play with some toy data" or importing small datasets.

Patch attached, or see the 4012 branch in my github. Current version tagged as
pending/4012.<a href="https://github.com/thepaul/cassandra/tree/4012"

New Comment: 
A couple things:<ul>	<li>the help for COPY is wrong, you can't use AND in the column
list</li>	<li>it would be nice if it output the number of rows created and perhaps the
time it took at the end, just so the user knows something happened</li></ul>Finally, since
we're targeting 'just want to play with it' users, maybe a full example in examples/ would
be useful. 


New Comment: 
Fixed help text and added a message reporting number of rows imported and time
elapsed.Updated the 4012 branch. New submission tagged pending/4012-2.

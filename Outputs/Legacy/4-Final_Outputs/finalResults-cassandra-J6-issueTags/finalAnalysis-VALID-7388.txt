Description: 

Extend SecondaryIndex to add a method that can be called from
SecondaryIndexManager.reload() when the underlying CF is updated.

New Comment: 
Added a method to SecondaryIndex, which provides a hook for implementations to
re-initialise themselves (if necessary) when SecondaryIndexManager.reload() is called. As
this was reloading the CFS behind KEYS indexes, that call moved into
KeysIndex.reload().Looking at trunk, where we also have CompositesIndex, it should be fine
to pull it up into AbstractSimplePerColumnSecondaryIndex.java - I can upload a second
patch from trunk if necessary. 


New Comment: 
Sorry, realised first version of the patch was missing a change in
SecondaryIndexColumnSizeTest, updated.

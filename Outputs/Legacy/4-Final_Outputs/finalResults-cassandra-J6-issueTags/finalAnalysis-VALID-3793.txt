Description: 

(Probably affects other versions, but I am on 0.7.3).

DatabaseDescriptor.defsVersion
should be protected by volatile since it is written to and read by multiple threads from
unsynchronized methods. This can manifest itself in schema agreement never occurring due
to a node broadcasting the wrong schema version.

Description: 

QueryProcessor includes the row key in "first *" because it mistakenly thinks the full
row is being requested.  "first *" should really be treated like a slice.

New Comment: 
Would like to take the approach outlined here but there isn't actually a way to tell if
the FIRST count was specified in the statement or not w/ the current antlr.  Re-assigning
to Pavel for antlr help. 


New Comment: 
Used Jonathan's skeleton with one modification - SelectStatement.isFullWildcard () was
changed to use !hasFirstSet because I think that intention here is not to include the key
when "FIRST" keyword is set.

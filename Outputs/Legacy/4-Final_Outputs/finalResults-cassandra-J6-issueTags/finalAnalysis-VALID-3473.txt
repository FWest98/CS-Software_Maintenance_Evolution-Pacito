Description: 

When trying to get code coverage results, if there are failing tests the ANT build will
fail.

Need to expose a property to allow ignoring test failures so that code coverage can
be recorded despite test failures (as a result of the code being instrumented)

New Comment: 
Attached patch will effect the request if the property "ant.test.failure.ignore" is
defined

New Comment: 
shouldn't codecoverage task automatically define ant.test.failure.ignore? 


New Comment: 
perhaps... but i prefer not to force the issue and let the CI build define whether it
wants the test failures to be ignored. That way you can have a set of different
criteria.Instrumented tests failing can actually be indicative of a number of threading
issues.I just want something that lets the CI build get code coverage... some people
(including me depending on the way the wind is blowing) feel that code coverage when tests
are failing is invalid as you are executing code paths that are not actually covered by
the tests.  We had a system which had about 3% higher coverage if 3 of the test cases were
failing than if they were passing... so in general you only trust test coverage when the
tests pass

@Gary.Nope it does not duplicate <a

data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-2258"><del>CASSANDRA-2258</del></a>.2258 is a legitimate bug,
this is required to support tracking and trending code coverage from the CI build server
in the light of issues such as 2258 arising

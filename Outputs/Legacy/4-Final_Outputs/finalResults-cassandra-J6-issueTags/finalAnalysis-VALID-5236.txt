Description: 

Through <a

the read command and CL is logged (under DEBUG) and it is very helpful. But I don't think
I have seen the same for mutation...

It'd be nice if we could also log this for the
mutation (and others?), please see the attached patch (just done on mutation) . Note also
this prints the IMutation which I did wonder if it is a good idea (could the list be so
large that it floods the log instead of being useful?)

sample output:
<div
class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent
panelContent"><pre>DEBUG [RPC-Thread:24] 2011-10-14 12:09:10,949 StorageProxy.java (line
171) Mutations/ConsistencyLevel is [RowMutation(keyspace='testks', key='70',
modifications=[ColumnFamily(testindx
[testcol:false:1@1318619350892000,])])]/ONE</pre></div></div>

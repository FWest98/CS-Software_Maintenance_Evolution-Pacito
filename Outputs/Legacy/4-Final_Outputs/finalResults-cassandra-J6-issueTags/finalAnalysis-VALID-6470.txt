Description: 

As described at the bottom of <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2749" title="fine-grained control
over data directories" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-2749"><del>CASSANDRA-2749</del></a>, we only need to worry about
total path length on Windows.  For other platforms we only need to check the filename
length.

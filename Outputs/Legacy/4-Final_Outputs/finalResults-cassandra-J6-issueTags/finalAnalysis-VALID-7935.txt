New Comment: 
Can we generalize this to "don't bother doing validation compactions for RF=1?" 


New Comment: 
Patch attached for 1.2.0 branch.<br/>Cassandra already skips repair when there is no
endpoint to repair with. This patch goes further and makes it skip queueing repair
session.<br/>I also did refactoring around various repair methods.

 Issue CASSANDRA-4994 Description 
=======================================

Project: Cassandra
-----------------

-----------------
Title: [CASSANDRA-4994] cassandra.yaml - actually separate server_encryption_options and client_encryption_options
-----------------

Summary: cassandra.yaml - actually separate server_encryption_options and client_encryption_options

Description: 

Currently they have different names but use the same option names, which doesn't make
sense for two reasons:
<ul class="alternate" type="square">	<li>internode_encryption:
none/all doesn't make sense for client encryption. Should be 'enabled:
true/false'</li>	<li>truststore and truststore_password are not used by Cassandra for
client encryption and shouldn't be present in client_encryption_options.</li></ul>
Moved
type-dependent options to either ServerEncryptionOptions or ClientEncryptionOptions. Left
truststore and truststore_password in EncryptionOptions for use by Stress and CLI (but
removed them from cassandra.yaml).

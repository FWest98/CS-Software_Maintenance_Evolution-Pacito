Description: 

Since streaming file to the node of different version is not allowed, and in fact it
would be the cause of repair hang, there is no point to allow repairing among the nodes of
different versions.

New Comment: 
Patch to fail repair when the participants' versions are different.<br/>Note that we don't
need to check if the node is pre-1.1 for sequential repair, I removed that check also. 


New Comment: 
I would change the message to "different protocol versions" or "different major releases"
since different minor releases should be okay.Otherwise +1 


New Comment: 
Committed with the message fix. Thanks! 


New Comment: 
The fix was unreliable because every time connection is closed, protocol version for that
connection is also reset (set to null), leading to not able to repair
randomly.<br/>Reverted from 1.2 branch and trunk for now.

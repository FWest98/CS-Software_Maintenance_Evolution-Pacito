Description: 

cqlsh should recognize cql3 syntax when in cql3 mode; this includes tab completing proper
syntax and properly quoting any terms in single- or double-quotes (current version only
knows how to use single quotes).

also, prefer using the term "TABLE" over "COLUMNFAMILY"
wherever one of those is generated from cqlsh (like in DESCRIBE output).

and if it's not
too bad, it would help to have the online help strings reflect cql3 syntax (maybe with a
nod to cql2 restrictions where appropriate).

New Comment: 
This fairly hefty patch does some refactoring in cqlsh to allow everything to use the
right sort of quoting in the right places, and to handle parsing in both modes with good
modular separation.Defines cql3 syntax so that it can be properly recognized and
completed.It might be worth holding off on a review for just a bit until I can finish the
test suite in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3920" title="tests
for cqlsh" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-3920"><del>CASSANDRA-3920</del></a>, so that the reviewer
doesn't need to take in all the changes at once.These changes are also split into much
smaller, more individually understandable commits in the 4198 branch in my github:<a
href="https://github.com/thepaul/cassandra/tree/4198" class="external-link"
rel="nofollow">https://github.com/thepaul/cassandra/tree/4198</a>Current version tagged
pending/4198.

Description: 

When debugging, often times on a live server you want to extract a certain key with
sst2j, but unfortunately you can't know which sstable(s) you need to run this on, causing
you to iterate over much more data than necessary.

Patch to add a getsstables command to nodetool. 


New Comment: 
Since markReferenced(key) uses interval tree to search sstables, you may get unrelated
sstables. If that is not intended, I uploaded patch to check if given key is actually in
referenced sstables by using SSTableReader#getPosition. Note that getPosition updates key
cache and bloom filter related stats, so I add flag to turn off caching and stats update.

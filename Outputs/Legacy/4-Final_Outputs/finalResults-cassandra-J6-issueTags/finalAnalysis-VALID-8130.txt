Description: 

Currently, many critical thread pools are sized according to the number of available
processors i.e. Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors() (See StageManager.java)

In a
multi-instance deployment, multiple Cassandra instances will independently assume that all
processors are available to it; there should be a mechanism to specify a smaller set of
processors (and perhaps have affinity).

New Comment: 
Adding a -D option to cassandra-env.sh would be cleanest. 


New Comment: 
Patch to override with -Dcassandra.available_processors 


New Comment: 
lgtm, +1 (piconit - IDEA's auto-import misplaced FBUtilities import in StageManager).

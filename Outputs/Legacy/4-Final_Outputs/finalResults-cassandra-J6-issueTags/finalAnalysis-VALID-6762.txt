Description: 

(Since I actually whined about this one in my Cassandra Europe talk i might as well fix
it)

Typing 'nodetool -h localhos ring' gives me 37 lines of scary looking call traces
with the significant information embeded in line 11 from the end. Just because I mistyped
my hostname.

I propose we catch common exceptions, print a more user friendly message to
stderr and exit.

Description: 

We've ran into many times where we do not want compaction to run right away against CFs
when booting up a node. If the node needs to compact, it will do so at the first flush

New Comment: 
Rather than adding an option for this, I think we should remove the check entirely. If the
node needs to compact, it will do so at the first flush, which is more likely to be
staggered across the cluster (and if this flush is forced by commitlogs, then AOK).

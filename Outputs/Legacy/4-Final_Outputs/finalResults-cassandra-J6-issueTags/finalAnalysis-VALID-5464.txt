that <tt>cqlsh</tt> doesn't start on Windows because the readline module is not
present.

<tt>cqlsh</tt> should be fixed to only use readline if it is present.

New Comment: 
Although cqlsh works on windows as is (both with cygwin and under the Command Prompt
application), it mistakenly tries to use ANSI escape codes for color under Command Prompt,
which show up as messy <tt>];34;40m</tt>-ish garbage.The improvements here make cqlsh
smarter about choosing whether to use color by default.

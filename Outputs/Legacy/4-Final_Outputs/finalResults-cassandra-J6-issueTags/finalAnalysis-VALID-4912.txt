Description: 

The summary says it all. Note that <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3178" title="Counter shard merging
is not thread safe" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-3178"><del>CASSANDRA-3178</del></a> will hopefully make that
option useless. But in the meantime, this breaks the tests in 1.0.0 since read repair
chance was set to 0.1 by default (while the test assumes merge_shard_chance is 1), so
let's fix that quickly.

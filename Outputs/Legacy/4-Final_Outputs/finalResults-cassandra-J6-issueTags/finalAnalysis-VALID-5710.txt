New Comment: 
This feels clunky to me.  Wouldn't it be better to have both CFS and non-CFS indexes
provide the same API so we can do it polymorphically w/ a single loop? 


New Comment: 
attached a different approach.  The polymorphic approach would still be clunky because it
includes self, so you need to get self + indexes.  latest patch seems more readable.

Description: 

As the title says, otherwise you get an NPE when the options are missing from the yaml. 
It's included in my second patch on <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3045" title="Update
ColumnFamilyOutputFormat to use new bulkload API" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-3045"><del>CASSANDRA-3045</del></a> and is a one line fix.

New Comment: 
There's a bunch of "if encryption options is null then ignore it" special cases already,
if you're going to instantiate a default instead then let's get rid of those.May also need
to be applied to 0.8 unless aforesaid special cases cover everything. 


New Comment: 
I could only find the special case added the first time we fixed this back in 0.8 for <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3007" title="NullPointerException in
MessagingService.java:420" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-3007"><del>CASSANDRA-3007</del></a>.  Attached patch removes
that and instantiates the default instead. 


New Comment: 
Hmm.  I thought the other place was OTC, but that's going to NPE in the current code base.
 So +1 for this patch. 


New Comment: 
(Checked, and 0.8 OTC does have the null check.  So we're good there.)

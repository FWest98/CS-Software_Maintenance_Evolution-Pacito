Are we sure of that? At least I'm sure I've create a CF with compositeType with the cli at
some point, though I suppose it may be broken since then. You do have to use quote though. 


New Comment: 
If we can, we should add an example in the help.  I asked Pavel before creating this
though and he told me to create it <img class="emoticon"

New Comment: 
And you can't really use just a CompositeType it returns 'Invalid definition for
comparator org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.CompositeType' 


New Comment: 
Hum, what I mean is that on the 1.0 branch, in the cli, you can do:<div
class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent
panelContent"><pre>[default@test] create column family cf with
comparator='CompositeType(UTF8Type,
Int32Type)';53c527f0-62e8-11e1-0000-fe8ebeead9f9Waiting for schema agreement...... schemas
agree across the cluster[default@test] set cf[a]['foo:3'] = 3;Value inserted.Elapsed time:
48 msec(s).[default@test] get cf[a];=&gt; (column=foo:3, value=03,
timestamp=1330528624015000)Returned 1 results.Elapsed time: 43 msec(s).</pre></div></div>I
agree that an example in the help would be great, and I suppose we could update the CLI so
that you don't need the quotes at all (though imho it's not worth the trouble), but it
works. 


New Comment: 
huh, if it works like that I think we can simply document that. 


New Comment: 
updated docs for create/update column family.

Description: 

removetoken takes a token parameter, but decommission works against the node where the
call is issued.  This allows confusion such as 'nodetool -h localhost decommission &lt;ip
or token&gt;' actually decommissioning the local node, instead of whatever was passed to
it.

New Comment: 
For 1.0 I'd like to see decom work like rt, and take a token parameter, but I don't want
to break existing jmx tools for 0.8, so let's just error on extra params there. 


New Comment: 
why add token param? 


New Comment: 
All zero-arg commands now complain when there's extra args.

Committed.

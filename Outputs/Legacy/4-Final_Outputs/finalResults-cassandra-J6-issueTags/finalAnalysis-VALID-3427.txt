Comments: 

New Comment: 
Adds a constructor that allows the user to modify the limit parameter used in
CassandraStorage to fetch fewer rows and use less memory in Cassandra. 


New Comment: 
is it actually useful to call setLimit post-construction, or should we make it final? 


New Comment: 
Yeah, fair point.  It isn't really useful, I was just letting eclipse write code for me. 


New Comment: 
new patch reflecting Jonathan Ellis' comment. 


New Comment: 
Corrected patch for final limit. 


New Comment: 
Matt - you mention super columns - are you iterating over super columns successfully, that
is are you able to access the data in subcolumns successfully? 


New Comment: 
Only for the purposes of counting the super columns, no access to the subcolumns. 


New Comment: 
okay - thank you - I just wanted to see if you found a way to dereference subcolumns even
with <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1849" title="Pig cannot
dereference Cassandra subcolumns in a Super Column Family" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="PIG-1849"><del>PIG-1849</del></a>. Sounds like you're not though.  Thanks. 


New Comment: 
patch fails to apply for me, is this against current 0.7 branch? 


New Comment: 
D'oh! I wrote it against a checkout of the 0.7.3 tag instead of trunk.  I'll port the
changes to trunk tonight.  Sorry for the confusion. 


New Comment: 
OK, third time's the charm, coded this one against trunk and just successfully applied it
to a fresh check-out. 


New Comment: 
added javadoc and committed.  thanks!

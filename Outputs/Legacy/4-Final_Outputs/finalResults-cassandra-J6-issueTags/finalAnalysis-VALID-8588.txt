Description: 

<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4767" title="Need some
indication of node repair success or failure" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-4767"><del>CASSANDRA-4767</del></a> makes nodetool repair
command to print progress, but when replica node is dead and repair cannot be proceeded,
nodetool repair just report session finished. Instead, nodetool should report session is
failed.

Also, it is nice to exit command with status code of 1 when repair failed.

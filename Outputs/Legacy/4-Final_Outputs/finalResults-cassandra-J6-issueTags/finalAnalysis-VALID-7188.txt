Description: 

RangeKeySample in org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService MBean can be really huge
(over 200MB in our case). That's a problem for monitoring tools as they're not build for
that. Recommended and often used mx4j may be killer in this situation.

It would be good
enough to make RangeKeySample "operation" instead of "attribute" in jmx. Looking at how
MBeanServer.registerMBean() works we can do one of the following:<br/>a) add some dummy
parameter to getRangeKeySample<br/>b) name it differently - not like getter (next time
somebody will rename it back)<br/>c) implement MXBean instead of MBean (a lot of
work)

Any of those work. All of them are "hacks". Any better idea?

BTW: It's blocker for
some installations. Our update to 1.1.2 caused downtime, downgrade back to 1.0.x, repairs,
etc.

New Comment: 
I would be fine with simply renaming it. 


New Comment: 
Same here. Renaming it to be an operation with a comment to explain why it shouldn't be
renamed back to an attribute. 


New Comment: 
"Sample" is also verb. We can rename it from getRangeKeySample() to sampleKeyRange(). Ok?

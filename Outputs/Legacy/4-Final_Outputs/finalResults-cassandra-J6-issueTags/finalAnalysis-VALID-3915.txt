New Comment: 
patch that extracts the "is this message one that should count towards blockfor" logic
into the waitingFor method; DatacenterReadCallback now only overrides those instead of all
of the response methods, which fixes the bug and reduces the surface for introducing
similar bugs in the future.  (applies on top of <a

v2.) 


New Comment: 
+1<br/>The patch applies on top of 0.8 (that is on top of <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2552" title="ReadResponseResolver
Race" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-2552"><del>CASSANDRA-2552</del></a> v2
for 0.8). Should be backported to 0.7 first I think.

Title: [CASSANDRA-3651] Truncate shouldn't rethrow timeouts as UA

Description: 

Truncate is a very easy operation to timeout, but the timeouts rethrow as
UnavailableException which is somewhat confusing.  Instead it should throw
TimedOutException.

New Comment: 
Doesn't updating the Thrift signature mean (Java) clients now have to catch or rethrow TOE
where before they did not?  If so we should probably do this in 1.1.

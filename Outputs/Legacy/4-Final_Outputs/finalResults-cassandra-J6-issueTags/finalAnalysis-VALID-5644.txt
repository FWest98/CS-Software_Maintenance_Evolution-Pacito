Description: 

RING_DELAY is what is consuming the majority of the time in the dtests.  Since these run
on localhost, it's safe to reduce this to save lots of time.  Also being able to change
this may obviate the need for <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3120" title="Move RING_DELAY and
operations that use it to Gossiper" class="issue-link"

New Comment:

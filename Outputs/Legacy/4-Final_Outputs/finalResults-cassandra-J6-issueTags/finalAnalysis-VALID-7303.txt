Description: 

Currently RecordReaders and RecordWriters use hardcoded TFramedTransport. In order to use
other transports, e.g. SSL transport, allow for setting custom transport class.

New Comment: 
I attach a patch enabling to set transport factory class in hadoop job configuration.
Added new properties "cassandra.input.transport.factory.class" and
"cassandra.output.transport.factory.class". TFramedTransportFactory is used by default if
properties are not set, so old behaviour is preserved. The modified code has been tested
using PIG demo in DSE.Patch generated against 1.1 branch (1.1.4).

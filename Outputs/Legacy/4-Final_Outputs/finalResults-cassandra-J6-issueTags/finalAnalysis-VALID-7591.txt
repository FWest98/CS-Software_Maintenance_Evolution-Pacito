New Comment: 
1.1 branch requires update to cql-internal-only-1.0.11.zip<br/>trunk required update to
cql-internal-only-1.2.1.zip<br/>Ideally they should be using the same version, but there
are some incompatibility issues with cql3 in 1.1 branch when using latest dbapi2 that I
hadn't time to fix.<br/>Also these changes should probably be included in cassandra-dbapi2
official repository - I'll have to open an issue on google code. 


New Comment: 
Factories are now functions and not classes. Also config_file is passed as an argument
too.And I still need new cassandra-dbapi2 release to be released. 


New Comment: 
cql-internal-only-1.3.0.zip is for trunk, cql-internal-only-1.0.10-4610.zip is for 1.1
branch. Decided against pushing an official 1.0.10+ release, this will be internal-only.

Memtable.resolve()
uses the count of columns in the CF to bump the op count however RowMutation.delete() does
not add any columns to the CF when an entire row is deleted. If a super column or column
is deleted it adds 1 towards the op count. Deleting many named columns will add many to
the op count.

Description: 

<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2311" title="type validated row
keys" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-2311"><del>CASSANDRA-2311</del></a>
allows typed keys. We also want to allow giving keys a name (that would need to conform to
the CF comparator). This is required for Hive support; <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1434" title="Cassandra Storage Handler"
class="issue-link" data-issue-key="HIVE-1434"><del>HIVE-1434</del></a> currently stores
that metadata in an external repository but it would be cleaner to keep it in CFMetadata.
This would allow CQL to support using the key name in select and where clauses, reducing
the impedance mismatch between JDBC/CQL and JDBC/Hive.

New Comment: 
Patch adds the prop.If CLI support and/or JMX calls are needed to expose this even
further, they can be added on this ticket.It would be nice to link the CQL dep. to this
ticket in case something comes up. 


New Comment: 
Unrelated to this ticket but stumbled upon, moved convertToCFMD(thrift CfDef) into CFMD.
It had no business being in CassandraServer.

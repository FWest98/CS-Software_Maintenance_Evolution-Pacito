Description: 

<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2892" title="Don&#39;t
&quot;replicate_on_write&quot; with RF=1" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="CASSANDRA-2892"><del>CASSANDRA-2892</del></a> mistakenly removed some
hints for counters, namely the hints that were supposed to be stored on the local node
(that is, instead of removing from the hintedEndpoints multimap only the local write
(since it has been already applied), we were removing everything having the local node as
destination).

New Comment: 
This won't work as is; dh_install doesn't support renaming a file while putting it into a
directory (it will make a directory named /etc/sysctl.d/cassandra.conf/ and put
cassandra-sysctl.conf in it).Attachment applies on top of original patch, does file rename
in debian/rules.+1 with this fix

Committed. 


New Comment: 
Looks like debian/cassandra-sysctl.conf didn't actually get committed.

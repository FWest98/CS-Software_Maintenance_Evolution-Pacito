New Comment: 
What is "succeeded" for stress?  Is timing out once a failure?  Or taking longer than X
minutes? 


New Comment: 
No, it just returns normally but you will see the error messages in the log (with number
of retries and other additional info such as exception type/message).

<blockquote>What is "succeeded" for stress? Is timing out once a failure? Or taking longer

hits the max number of retries. Pretty much any time that it used to hang indefinitely.

hanging; by this ticket I was hoping for a return value to tell when it goes really wrong
(the cases that previously caused hanging). It would be nice if it is an easy change. I'm
ok with parsing the output or a log though, since like Jonathan pointed out, "succeeded"
in stress isn't always obvious. 


New Comment: 
Consider it a failure if the producer or any of the consumers fail.

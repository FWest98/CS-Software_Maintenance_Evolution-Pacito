Comments: 

New Comment: 
System.exit(1); was added by Gary Dusbabek at 2011-04-15 12:48:15 +0000, only
cassandra-0.8 and trunk are affected this patch applies for both of them. 


New Comment: 
Looks like Jonathan actually added this on the 14th (Gary merged it to trunk), probably
errantly while debugging something else.  Committed.

Description: 

Without the ant-optional package installed in Debian, builds fail (on lenny) with:

   
Could not create type regexpmapper due to No supported regular expression matcher found:
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.tools.ant.util.regexp.Jdk14RegexpMatcher

The
attached patch makes it build. Tested on lenny and squeeze.

New Comment: 
(Ok, I hope the patch got uploaded alright. Not yet used to the new JIRA. I attached it
separately as a file, as the 'submit patch' action didn't seem to offer an actual file
upload facility.) 


New Comment: 
+1 this from me, fwiw 


New Comment: 
committed, thanks! 


New Comment: 
+1 again, but this time With Authority!  The extra dependency is both necessary and
satisfiable on all debian/ubuntu releases since 2008 (Lenny/Hardy or later), and it's
doubtful that Cassandra builds, runs correctly, and is properly supportable on older
releases anyway.

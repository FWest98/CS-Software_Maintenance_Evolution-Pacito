Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-467 (IoFilter has to filter a setTrafficMask call.)
    * Added IoFilter.filterSetTrafficMask
    * ReadThrottleFilter now overrides filterSetTrafficMask handler
    * Fixed a bug where ReadThrottlePolicy is not enforced correctly

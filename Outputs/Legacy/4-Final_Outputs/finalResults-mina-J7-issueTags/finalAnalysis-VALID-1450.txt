New Comment: 
I've added Javadoc comments to the classes and methods. Please note that I have never used
this package myself, I've only studied the code. There may be errors in the comments. I'd
be very thankful if someone who have actually used this package could take a look. 


New Comment: 
Thanks a lot Niklas !!This portion of the code (state machine) is not, by far, the less
documented one in MINA. I went through all the classes in MINA, adding some TODO tags in
all the class headers, and this sub-project was clean (there are 90 files out of 476
without headers ...).This is a very valuable effort, even if it seems to be obscur, and
painfull, but this make the project much better !Julien, you may consider closing the
issue.

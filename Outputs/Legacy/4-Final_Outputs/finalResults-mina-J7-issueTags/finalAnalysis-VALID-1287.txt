Description: 

It seems like the next version of SLF4J is going to support MDC for  java.util.logging
<br/>The users who use java.util.logging as their logging framework will have access to
MDC<br/>so that they can implement a formatter which prints out the MDC content. <br/>This
means we can get rid of IoSessionLogger completely and rely on
MdcInjectionFilter

However, probably SLF4J won't provide a MDC-aware Formatter
implementation for java.util.logging, so we might need to include it<br/>in
org.apache.mina.util package as an alternative solution.

New Comment: 
IoSessionLogger has been removed, but I could not yet add MDC-aware Formatter
implementations because the new SLF4J hasn't been released.I also fixed a performance
issue in LoggingFilter: message.toString() was invoked for every messageReceived and
messageSent event, regardless of the configured log-levels.

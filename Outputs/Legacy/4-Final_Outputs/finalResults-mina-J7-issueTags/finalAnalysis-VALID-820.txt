Description: 

In both of TextLineDecoder's decoding methods, the decoder only checks the size of input
after it's found at least one line ending character.  Infinitely long streams of, say,
'y's will cause the decoder to try to buffer up data until the JVM falls over.

New Comment: 
It seems to me that there's no reason to buffer up more than (maximum encoding size) *
(line length) bytes + overflow from one receive call, anyways.  For practical purposes the
maximum encoding size is 4 bytes, I believe.Alternately, the line length cap should either
be replaced or augmented by a byte length cap (defaulting to the above, maybe) to give
users a little more control over whether or not to die of OutOfMemoryErrors. 


New Comment: 
Oh, and by "trivial" I mean "run the following"(while true; do echo -n
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy; done) | nc host portand watch the JVM fall over. 


New Comment: 
Attached a patch that should resolve it.  I was unable to submit "too long" messages using
either decoding path. 


New Comment: 
Patch applies to the current 1.1.3 tag, incidentally.

maximum line length, the decoder stops recognizing the termination sequence, and is
therefore doomed anyway.  Is there some elegant way to reject the offending line and start
over? 


New Comment: 
Thank you very much for the patch and the inspiration.  The bug has been fixed.  I made
sure OOM is not thrown anymore and decoder continues to decode even after too long text
line.  Please confirm if the bug has been fixed and close this issue.One difference from
no-dos.patch is that OOM is not thrown immediately.  It keeps discarding incoming data
when client sends too long line, and throws an OOM error when EOL (line delimiter) is
encountered.  It was necessary behavior to make the decoder continue to work even after
encountering broken data.  ProtocolCodecFilter also has been improved to continue decoding
after an exception is thrown.  Please refer to the svn commit log for the detailed
information.  All these changes shouldn't affect existing applications. 


New Comment: 
I finally got a chance to test this out &#8211; it works great!  I had a look at the code,
and if I understand what it's doing it's good enough for my purposes.  You might want to
document the exact semantics of the line length limit in the javadocs somewhere; they're a
little vague right now.

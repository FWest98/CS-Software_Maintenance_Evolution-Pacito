commit b9d5c894ea041beb2dbc0e2bdf2f205bfc9d1aed
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Related issue: DIRMINA-365 (Make use of covariant return types)
    * Applied covariant return types to all core classes (except VM pipe transport in trunk.  It needs more work.)
    * We can't do much with covariant return type not introducing transport-specific session types such as SocketSession, so you will have to use trunk to get the most out of it.  1.1 has limited support on the other hand.

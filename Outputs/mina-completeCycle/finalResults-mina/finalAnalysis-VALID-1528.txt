Description: 

In response to <a href="http://markmail.org/message/fhjl74dnlyaojrzr"
class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://markmail.org/message/fhjl74dnlyaojrzr</a> ,
here's an updated release.xml file. 

It generally works as it should, but it's affected
by <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MASSEMBLY-285" class="external-link"
rel="nofollow">http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MASSEMBLY-285</a>, which causes duplicate
entries in the lib/ directory inside the archive. When extracting the archive using 7zip
for win32, I get prompted to overwrite/skip/cancel for each duplicate entry. Other
archivers may file entirely <img class="emoticon"
src="https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/help_16.png" height="16"
width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>. The only work-around I can come up with
as a fix right now is to add a maven-antrun-plugin to the package phase of the root pom
which post-processes the release file to fix this. I haven't done that, but if <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MASSEMBLY-285" title="regression: duplicate
files added to the assembly" class="issue-link"
data-issue-key="MASSEMBLY-285"><del>MASSEMBLY-285</del></a> isn't fixed before the next
release, we may have to.

Description: 

Hi,

There was mention of a synchronous client api for MINA on the mailing list, so I
thought I'd offer my implementation.

As
far as I can tell it works, but I've never given it a good run under heavy load.  The
areas I think could use some review are:<br/>Connection - possible to use generics?  Only
makes sense if you can tie it to what the filters are doing I
think.<br/>ConnectionFactoryImpl - is the managedSessions processing
required?<br/>SequentialExecutor/DaemonThreadFactory - are there better/pre existing ways
of doing these?<br/>Connection/NonBlockingConnection - any point having them separate? 
Did this initially for JCA resource adapter idea - didn't want to offer non blocking to
EJB clients.

Regards,<br/>Brad.

commit 95c8a64382b1a428b6dc29ef8b128587ba87b85b
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Applied Greg's patch on DIRMINA-162 (datagram session management fails) with small modification:
    * Changed the type of TTL and expiration interval to integer (seconds).
    * ExpirationSessionRecycler doesn't implement ExpirationListener directly. I made an inner class instead.
    * Removed the static getInstance() method in ExpiringSessionRecycler because we are already using a static global expirer by default. We need some documentation on creating many recyclers though.

Description: 

As of mina 0.9.0 the session management does not work in various ways:
<ul
class="alternate" type="square">	<li>a new session is created per received package. The
worker thread does not cache created session but only assign the select key to the session
and drops it after processing the package. It would be better to attach the session to the
RegistrationRequest and check it while processing the received package.</li>	<li>the
provided IoFilterChainBuilder does get applied to the created datagram session. It is
cached in the RegistrationRequest but not used on the session</li>	<li>The sessionClose
lifecycle event is not applied on the session either.</li></ul>

Description: 

Currently, I/O processor threads belong to its parent IoService, which means that I/O
processors cannot be shared among different services.  This becomes a serious issue when
more than one service is deployed into the same JVM.  Therefore, we need a way to share
the I/O processors among the services with the same transport type.

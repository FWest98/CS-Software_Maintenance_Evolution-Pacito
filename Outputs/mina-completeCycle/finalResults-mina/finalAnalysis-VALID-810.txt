Description: 

Currently, many existing filters such as ProtocolCodecFilter can't be added more than
once to the same filter chain.  It is because filters usually store its state information
as a session attribute; adding more than one filters of the same type will mess their
internal state.

Therefore, users can't do something more complex like multi-layered
protocol implementation.

To resolve this issue, all filter implementations must create
its session attribute key dynamically, instead of using a static key.

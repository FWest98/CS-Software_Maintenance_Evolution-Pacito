commit e8b5fa0414ecc9873388fee6f7a382574db4fd3b
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Generified IoFutureListener - no need to down cast IoFuture anymore!
    * Fixed some compiler warnings
    * Resolved issue: DIRMINA-432 (IoService method for writing Object to all the managed IoSession)
    ** Added CompositeIoFuture
    ** Added MessageBroadcaster
    ** NOTE: I found returning Map<IoSession, WriteFuture> is not necessary because the caller already knows which session is associated with which WriteFuture.

Description: 

Would be convenient to ad a method to IoService for writing a message to all the managed
sessions.<br/>in IoService : <br/>public WriteFuture writeAllSession(Object message);

the
implementation could be done in AbstractIoService.

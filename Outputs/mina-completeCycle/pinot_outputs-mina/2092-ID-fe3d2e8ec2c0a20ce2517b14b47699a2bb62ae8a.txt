--------- Original GoF Patterns ----------



Strategy Pattern.
EventRunner is the Context class.
Event is the Strategy interface.
Concrete Strategy classes:  SentEvent ReceiveEvent OpenEvent IdleEvent CloseEvent
Delegation through event of type Event

Strategy Pattern.
DefaultWriteRequest is the Context class.
IoFuture is the Strategy interface.
Concrete Strategy classes:  AbstractIoFuture DefaultWriteFuture
Delegation through future of type IoFuture

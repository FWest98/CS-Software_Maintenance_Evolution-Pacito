commit 73cc4a1404c9e295c849f5c921c849d387dd0ae2
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-547 - Reduce unnecessary thread creation and destruction caused by IdleStatusChecker
    * IdleStatusChecker is not a singleton anymore
    * One AbstractIoService has one IdleStatusChecker thread
    * An IdleStatusChecker thread starts automatically when a new service is created, and stops when the service is disposed.

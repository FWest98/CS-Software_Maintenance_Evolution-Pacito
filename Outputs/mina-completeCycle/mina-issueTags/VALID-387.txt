commit adf11feaec713566949d08a0adbaaaa4c2ed4a34
Author: Niklas Therning <niklas@apache.org>

    * DIRMINA-314: LoggingFilter will now log each event to different loggers. The loggers share a common prefix which is configurable. By default this prefix will be the name of the logger used by SessionLog.
    * Made SessionLog.getLogger() public and added SessionLog.getPrefix().
    * The logger and prefix used by SessionLog can now be configured using the static SessionLog.setPrefix() and SessionLog.setLogger() methods. This is easier than having to add an attribute to the session.

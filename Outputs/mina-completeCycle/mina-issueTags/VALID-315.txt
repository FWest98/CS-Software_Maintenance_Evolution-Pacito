commit 95c8a64382b1a428b6dc29ef8b128587ba87b85b
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Applied Greg's patch on DIRMINA-162 (datagram session management fails) with small modification:
    * Changed the type of TTL and expiration interval to integer (seconds).
    * ExpirationSessionRecycler doesn't implement ExpirationListener directly. I made an inner class instead.
    * Removed the static getInstance() method in ExpiringSessionRecycler because we are already using a static global expirer by default. We need some documentation on creating many recyclers though.

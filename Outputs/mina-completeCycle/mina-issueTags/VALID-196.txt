commit e2f3e703c93d3a38ea84793880a51b25f15ada96
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-217 (Make IoFuture and its subclasses interfaces)
    * Changed IoFuture and its subclasses into interfaces
    * Extracted their implementations to common.support.DefaultXxxFuture
    * IoFilter.WriteRequest.UNUSED_FUTURE directly implements WriteFuture now.
      * This change broke StreamWriterFilterTest. I fixed it, too.

commit b6a4ebf0451647ef394ebe5cfb8e99786886b5f5
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Related issue: DIRMINA-179 (Stream compression support)
    * Applied Vinod's patch
    ** Removed algorithm parameter because ZLib is the only algorithm for now.  We'll have to provide an interface such as CompressionAlgorithm and let user provide it as a parameter.
    * systemPath in pom.xml doesn't work well with the bundled Eclipse plugin; upgraded to 2.1

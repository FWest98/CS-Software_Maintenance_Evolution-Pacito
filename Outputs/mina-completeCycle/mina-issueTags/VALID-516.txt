commit 5dd3616c3827aa32c36be74c35194465c20a2f77
Author: Mark Webb <mwebb@apache.org>

    initial commit for the UDP example.  This example will have a server which will listen for packets that will represent the amount of memory used by a client application.  While this is just an example, there could be some 'real world' applicability with it.
    Thanks for Brigham Stevens for his contribution on the SimpleSessionRecycler code.  This class might be placed into the baseline, but that is a discussion for later.
    As for now, I just wanted to check this in so that we would at least have something.  I will follow this up with a tutorial in the MINA documentation site.

commit b0e42f13342f124722c0bd71f61555b00278f210
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Related issue: DIRMINA-366 (Default socket option values are retrieved incorrectly.)
    * Made sure the default reuseAddress value of an accepted socket to be true
    * Removed unnecessary code in DatagramSessionConfig implementations
    * Removed SessionUtil in trunk because it's hardly useful
    * Removed a sentence in SessionUtil that sets reuseAddress to true bindly which can cause a problem for a non-acceptor session

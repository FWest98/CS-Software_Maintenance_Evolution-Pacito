commit 2dd14695b969df61d2e68bd3451f7365c7fc191f
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Fixed issue: DIRMINA-214 (The InputStream that StreamIoHandler provides is closed too early.)
    * StreamIoHandler doesn't close Input/OutputStream.  A user has to close them explicitly.
    * Optimized memory usage of IoSessionOutputStream

commit 7552914ee19534ce18409bca581723551f6d008e
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-548 - subclass of CumulativeDecoder throws an UnsupportedOperationException if IoBuffer.slice() is used
    * Modified CumulativeProtocolDecoder to reallocate its internal buffer if it detects auto-expansion has been disabled.
    * Added the related test case, and it passed
    * Removed unnecessary class - UnderivableBuffer

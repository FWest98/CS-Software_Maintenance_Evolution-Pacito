commit 6d7481a125a6c24cfd4b8b8eda7bdfac4358e2aa
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Removed I/O spinning on the reader side because it seems like there's no effect at all
    * Instead, increased the write spinning loop count to 256, which improves memory utilization and write throughput significantly.

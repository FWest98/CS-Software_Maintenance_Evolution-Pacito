commit 5a2ef13bb1830860d03b6dd802743c9ff395b5b7
Author: Edouard De Oliveira <edeoliveira@apache.org>

    Fix for DIRMINA-714: changes default event ordered to be all but the SESSION_CREATED event
    This allow the filter to behave like it should for basic usage leaving the ability of fine grain control for advanced users

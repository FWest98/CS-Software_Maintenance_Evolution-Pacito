commit c1b067a3959a730c2559b89b9c85c519174b566b
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Fixed a problem that Socket.setReceiveBufferSize() is called unnecessarily if ServerSocket.setReceiveBufferSize() is already called with the default value - DefaultSocketSessionConfig keeps track of the change of the default receiveBufferSize to solve this problem.
    * Made MdcInjectionFilterTest to dispose connectors

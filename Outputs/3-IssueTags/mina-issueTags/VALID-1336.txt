commit e15b5373186aaeaa5e3403e87e020ba5c4012467
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMiNA-551 - IoBuffer doesn't double up on auto-expansion.
    * Fixed AbstractIoBuffer to double up on auto-expansion
    * Fixing 1.x costs more than 2.x, so I ended up fixing documentation.

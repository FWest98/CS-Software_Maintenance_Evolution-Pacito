commit 0e4f0472c69422faef1b483cc6bf3bc6a8ea413a
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Added IoConnector.defaultRemoteAddress
    * Added IoConnector.connect() which uses defaultRemoteAddress as an endpoint.
    ** This is very useful when a user want to initiate connection attempt from an IoC container, by setting defaultRemoteAddress property and setting connect() method as an initializer.

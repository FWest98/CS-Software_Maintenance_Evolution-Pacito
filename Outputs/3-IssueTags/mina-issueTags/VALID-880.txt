commit 7bdc0e26883825ba54337620ae631a276f1b70ba
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-249 (exceptionCaught() should provide more information)
    * Added WriteException which contains the list of the failed WriteRequests
    * All write-related exceptions extend WriteException now.
    * Added NothingWrittenException
    * Added WriteToClosedSessionException
    * WriteFuture also provides 'exception' property to tell the cause of the write failure; all failed WriteFutures must provide a related exception now.
    * All queued write requests which couldn't be written out due to sudden disconnection are notified as an exceptionCaught event with WriteToClosedSessionException now.
    * Improved SslFilter to filter out WriteToClosedSessionException which contains a failed close_notify request.

commit f58daada3640d0d8caa143fb516e4976e421f8a2
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-449 (Improve current JMX integration code using new statistical properties.)
    * Renamed IoSessionStat to IoStatistics because it can be used for IoService too.
    * Renamed StatCollector to IoStatisticsCollector
    * Renamed many methods for consistent naming aligned with IoSession and IoService
    * Changed IoStatisticsCollector to use the performance counters that a service provides to calculate per-service throughput

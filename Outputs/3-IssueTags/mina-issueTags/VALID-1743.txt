commit b4c50138846591500003dba8ec81cd7d93ad5963
Author: Emmanuel Lecharny <elecharny@apache.org>

    o Added a Logger
    o Few Javadoc, renaming and comments added
    o The updateTrafficMask method has been fixed : if there were one single session in the OPENING state, then the loop was exited, leaving some potential other sessions pending
    o Added a check for a broken session in the main loop of the processor, to avoid creating a new selector for nothing in this case

commit a476b7ae3d36e22fecc06d11fcb6d33392b658ab
Author: Emmanuel Lecharny <elecharny@apache.org>

    o Added some comments
    o Added some Javadoc
    o Moved the checkDeadlock call to avoid a systematic call in the await() method. It's now called only if the ready flag is not true, in the finally part.

commit cef7a536e43f361afdca8dd2b659c2edeb240f4f
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    * Minimized the number of interestOps(int) calls
    * Tiny optimization: AbstractPollingIoProcessor.flush() now flushes write request queue immediately if the operation is called from the worker thread itself.

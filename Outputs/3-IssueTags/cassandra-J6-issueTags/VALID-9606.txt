commit 72b1a1b4989212267dba9a8d389af21d24423533
Author: Jason Brown <jasedbrown@gmail.com>

    ITC.close() resets peer msg version, causes connection thrashing in ec2 during upgrade.
    Second pass, where we have Ec2MRS check that the perr node is on the same MS.current_version before
    closing connection on publicIP and reconnecting on privateIP

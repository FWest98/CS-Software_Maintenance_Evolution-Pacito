commit 7c9e7111449296dc2346e254f6ed07312a0b5a9e
Author: Emmanuel Lecharny <elecharny@apache.org>

    o Renamed the bind0 method to bindInternal, which is slightly more meaningfull
    o Added some comments, plus minor refactoring
    o Removed the void bind(SocketAddress localAddress) and bind(SocketAddress firstLocalAddress, SocketAddress... otherLocalAddresses) methods, and replaced them with a void bind(SocketAddress... addresses) (both cases are covered with this single method, and it has no impact on the existing code using those removed methods.
    o Added a toString() method to AbstractIoAcceptor

commit a6971c1962296dd852aef7273b206f669d92928b
Author: Mark Webb <mwebb@apache.org>

    JIRA 611.  The ExceptionMonitor belongs in util, not core.  I brought this issue up in the dev mailing list and many people have agreed to this.  I am just getting around to it now, as I forgot to make the change when it was originally brought up on the mailing list.

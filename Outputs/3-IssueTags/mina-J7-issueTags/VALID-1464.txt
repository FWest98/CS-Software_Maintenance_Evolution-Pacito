commit e29193adeb7665d4870a1d9a1c45fe44a2e2c681
Author: Emmanuel Lecharny <elecharny@apache.org>

    o Removed the DatagramService and SocketService interfaces as they are useless. The getSessionConfig method already exists in the IoService interface
    o Modified the classes which implemented those two interfaces accordingly

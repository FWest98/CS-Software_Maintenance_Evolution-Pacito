commit ad7024dfde946cca2df52691a84966e1b8582dc5
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Resolved issue: DIRMINA-452 (IdentittyHashMap Iterator has bug in it.)
    * Replaced IdentityHashMap/Set with HashMap/Set in IdleStatusChecker.
    * I couldn't find any other places that calls Iterator.remove() on IdentityHashMap/Set, so I retained the other code.

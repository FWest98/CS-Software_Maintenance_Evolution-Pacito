commit 571f6cb69688d9ede96ffbb618eb77607f47e810
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Replaced IoBuffer.preferDirectBuffers with IoBuffer.useDirectBuffer; preferDirectBuffers leads unpredictable application behavior because the application doesn't know what type of buffer will be allocated when the application is under load.

commit a2d136046f67d5fb29bcb7b5b98a137d61549349
Author: Julien Vermillard <jvermillard@apache.org>

    merging some code simplification :
     * Removed IoService idle event, you still have IoSession idle.
     * Reworked IdleStatusChecker for make the code easier to understand.
     * Removed setTrafficMask and keeped suspendWrite / suspendRead methods.
     * Removed trafficMask event from the IoFilter chain.
     * Applied http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRMINA-620 by
       removing superfluous IoSession close() methods. When you close a
       session, you need to use session.close(boolean); and say explicitly
       if you want to flush the write queue or no.

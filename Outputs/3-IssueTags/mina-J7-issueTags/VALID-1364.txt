commit 92d4586b9a99a4d4344fb526ce5f84ab23790b02
Author: Niklas Therning <niklas@apache.org>

    Fixed DIRMINA-559: StateMachineProxyFactory has been renamed to StateMachineProxyBuilder and there are now some boolean flags which control whether methods on the proxied interfaces which cannot be converted into events should be ignored or not.

commit 34ddcd4134dba61bdd76b6d6a99c29143b857d54
Author: Trustin Lee <trustin@apache.org>

    Fixed issue: DIRMINA-469 (Write throughput is horribly low.)
    * Fixed as described in the issue tracker; removed the problematic if statement and added another sanity check code that doesn't cause the problem.

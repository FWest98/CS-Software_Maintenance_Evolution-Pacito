commit a8c16d7b84dbecf7e4846b8ce0875c42ef05947a
Author: Emmanuel Lecharny <elecharny@apache.org>

    o Removed all the useless methods in the Head filter : they are just bypasses.
    o Added a ToString method into the EntryImpl class
    o Improved the existing Filter toString() method to expose usefull traces, instead of a bunch of junk

//
// Inflate deflated (PKZIP's method 8 compressed) data.  The compression
// method searches for as much of the current string of bytes (up to a
// length of 258) in the previous 32K bytes.  If it doesn't find any
// matches (of at least length 3), it codes the next byte.  Otherwise, it
// codes the length of the matched string and its distance backwards from
// the current position.  There is a single Huffman code that codes both
// single bytes (called "literals") and match lengths.  A second Huffman
// code codes the distance information, which follows a length code.  Each
// length or distance code actually represents a base value and a number
// of "extra" (sometimes zero) bits to get to add to the base value.  At
// the end of each deflated block is a special end-of-block (EOB) literal/
// length code.  The decoding process is basically: get a literal/length
// code; if EOB then done; if a literal, emit the decoded byte; if a
// length then get the distance and emit the referred-to bytes from the
// sliding window of previously emitted data.

// There are (currently) three kinds of inflate blocks: stored, fixed, and
// dynamic.  The compressor outputs a chunk of data at a time and decides
// which method to use on a chunk-by-chunk basis.  A chunk might typically
// be 32K to 64K, uncompressed.  If the chunk is uncompressible, then the
// "stored" method is used.  In this case, the bytes are simply stored as
// is, eight bits per byte, with none of the above coding.  The bytes are
// preceded by a count, since there is no longer an EOB code.

// If the data are compressible, then either the fixed or dynamic methods
// are used.  In the dynamic method, the compressed data are preceded by
// an encoding of the literal/length and distance Huffman codes that are
// to be used to decode this block.  The representation is itself Huffman
// coded, and so is preceded by a description of that code.  These code
// descriptions take up a little space, and so for small blocks, there is
// a predefined set of codes, called the fixed codes.  The fixed method is
// used if the block ends up smaller that way (usually for quite small
// chunks); otherwise the dynamic method is used.  In the latter case, the
// codes are customized to the probabilities in the current block and so
// can code it much better than the pre-determined fixed codes can.

// The Huffman codes themselves are decoded using a multi-level table
// lookup, in order to maximize the speed of decoding plus the speed of
// building the decoding tables.  See the comments below that precede the
// lbits and dbits tuning parameters.

// GRR:  return values(?)
//         0  OK
//         1  incomplete table
//         2  bad input
//         3  not enough memory
//

//
// If BMAX needs to be larger than 16, then h and x[] should be unsigned long.
//
#define BMAX 16         /* maximum bit length of any code (16 for explode) */
#define N_MAX 288       /* maximum number of codes in any set */


//
// Notes beyond the 1.93a appnote.txt:

// 1. Distance pointers never point before the beginning of the output
//    stream.
// 2. Distance pointers can point back across blocks, up to 32k away.
// 3. There is an implied maximum of 7 bits for the bit length table and
//    15 bits for the actual data.
// 4. If only one code exists, then it is encoded using one bit.  (Zero
//    would be more efficient, but perhaps a little confusing.)  If two
//    codes exist, they are coded using one bit each (0 and 1).
// 5. There is no way of sending zero distance codes--a dummy must be
//    sent if there are none.  (History: a pre 2.0 version of PKZIP would
//    store blocks with no distance codes, but this was discovered to be
//    too harsh a criterion.)  Valid only for 1.93a.  2.04c does allow
//    zero distance codes, which is sent as one code of zero bits in
//    length.
// 6. There are up to 286 literal/length codes.  Code 256 represents the
//    end-of-block.  Note however that the static length tree defines
//    288 codes just to fill out the Huffman codes.  Codes 286 and 287
//    cannot be used though, since there is no length base or extra bits
//    defined for them.  Similarily, there are up to 30 distance codes.
//    However, static trees define 32 codes (all 5 bits) to fill out the
//    Huffman codes, but the last two had better not show up in the data.
// 7. Unzip can check dynamic Huffman blocks for complete code sets.
//    The exception is that a single code would not be complete (see #4).
// 8. The five bits following the block type is really the number of
//    literal codes sent minus 257.
// 9. Length codes 8,16,16 are interpreted as 13 length codes of 8 bits
//    (1+6+6).  Therefore, to output three times the length, you output
//    three codes (1+1+1), whereas to output four times the same length,
//    you only need two codes (1+3).  Hmm.
//10. In the tree reconstruction algorithm, Code = Code + Increment
//    only if BitLength(i) is not zero.  (Pretty obvious.)
//11. Correction: 4 Bits: # of Bit Length codes - 4     (4 - 19)
//12. Note: length code 284 can represent 227-258, but length code 285
//    really is 258.  The last length deserves its own, short code
//    since it gets used a lot in very redundant files.  The length
//    258 is special since 258 - 3 (the min match length) is 255.
//13. The literal/length and distance code bit lengths are read as a
//    single stream of lengths.  It is possible (and advantageous) for
//    a repeat code (16, 17, or 18) to go across the boundary between
//    the two sets of lengths.

    // Huffman code decoding is performed using a multi-level table lookup.
    // The fastest way to decode is to simply build a lookup table whose
    // size is determined by the longest code.  However, the time it takes
    // to build this table can also be a factor if the data being decoded
    // are not very long.  The most common codes are necessarily the
    // shortest codes, so those codes dominate the decoding time, and hence
    // the speed.  The idea is you can have a shorter table that decodes the
    // shorter, more probable codes, and then point to subsidiary tables for
    // the longer codes.  The time it costs to decode the longer codes is
    // then traded against the time it takes to make longer tables.

    // below.  lbits is the number of bits the first level table for literal/
